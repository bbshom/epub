<p class="btnis">Here are some tips to keep in mind when interviewing or interrogating a child:</p>
<p class="bbp">•    Explain why the interview is taking place, and focus on helping the child feel comfortable and safe.</p>
<p class="bbp">•    Establish that the child understands the difference between telling a lie and telling the truth, and that it’s okay to say “I don’t know” or “I don’t understand.”</p>
<p class="bbp">•    Be aware that children might say what they think you want to hear rather than speak honestly.</p>
<p class="bbp">•    Tell stories about yourself when you were growing up. Sharing something you did that you shouldn’t have done when you were their age helps them to connect with you and see that you understand what they’re going through.</p>
<p class="bbp">•    Ask concrete, simple questions. When using conceptual terms (over/under, up/down, in/out, before/after, today/yesterday/tomorrow), make sure the child understands.</p>
<p class="bbp">•    As a parent, pick your battles. Save your monologue approach for the times when it’s really needed—situations like cheating in school, involvement with drugs, or criminal activity. Overuse with matters like whether the child did her homework or cleaned up her room will diminish its effectiveness.</p>
<p class="bbp">•    Avoid lying to your child. That puts you on much firmer ground when you’re trying to get him to tell you the truth.</p>

<p class="diatx">Paulette, let me ask you this: Were you really trying to hurt Mr. X and the others, or were you just playing around?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> Playing around, that’s all.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Thanks for that, Paulette. I’m proud of you. It’s all going to work out.</p>
<p class="stnis">Michael and Mr. Jones had their answer. It wasn’t the answer that Mr. Jones had hoped for, but he accepted it, and he commended Michael for his success in getting the truth. The lawsuit was never filed.</p>
