<p class="stx">“This is Detective Williams with the State Police. Please call me at this number at your earliest convenience. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="tx">Your heart starts beating a mile a minute. Why on earth is a State Police detective calling you? You know you haven’t done anything wrong. You even turn your phone off whenever you’re supposed to. Doesn’t matter. Your heart is still racing. <span class="epub-i">What did I do?</span> The fact of the matter is, there are any number of perfectly reasonable explanations for the call that have nothing to do with any wrongdoing on your part. Maybe Detective Williams dialed the wrong number. Maybe he was doing fundraising for the families of deceased and disabled police officers. Maybe there was a burglary on your street, and he was calling everyone who lived nearby to see if they’d seen any suspicious activity. Your mind went to none of those places. You were too busy jumping from bleak scenario to bleak scenario. How are you going to explain whatever they think you did wrong to your significant other and your family? Are you going to need a lawyer? You don’t even know any lawyers. Except that guy at the gym, but he’s an imbecile. Are you going to have to take time off from work? If you do, what should you tell your boss?</p>
<p class="tx">By the time you get home, you’re frantic. And it’s all because of a very simple diagnosis. You’ve contracted a mind virus.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i">Mind virus</span> is a colloquial term for the psychological discomfort a person feels when he receives information that has potentially negative consequences, causing his mind to race with hypothetical ramifications of the information. We’re all vulnerable to them. There’s no inoculation that can protect us from them.</p>
<p class="tx">The mind virus phenomenon is one that will tend to work to your advantage in an elicitation situation, and you can even use it to great effect when the hypothetical consequences are positive. The way to trigger it is by using implicit, rather than explicit, language.</p>
<p class="tx">Let’s say you’re a school administrator, and you’re speaking with a student who, according to three of his classmates, had brought a gun into school the day before. The students didn’t report it until today, and a search of his locker and belongings failed to turn up any gun. The most likely scenario, given the information you have, is that the student brought the gun to school yesterday, but took it home at the end of the day and left it there. Still, if he did bring a gun into the school, you need to know.</p>
<p class="tx">Now, you clearly can’t say to him, “If you tell me, we’re not going to expel you.” But what you can say is something on the order of, “Our goal here is to get this resolved—to understand why this issue has come up, and to get it worked out.” Then you let his mind take that and run with it. Let him put his own spin on what “resolve” means, what “worked out” means. Then, if he does come out and ask what “resolve” means, don’t box yourself in. You might respond with something like this:</p>
<p class="tx">“Listen, ‘resolve’ simply means that we need to understand why this happened. Once we understand why this happened, then we can think about next steps. We can’t even begin to think about next steps at this point, because we have no idea why it happened. We know what, we know who, but we don’t know why. You need to help us understand that. Then we can figure out where to go from there.”</p>
<p class="tx">The beautiful part is that if the consequences go against him, he understands that it’s his fault—it’s not your fault, it’s not the school’s fault, it’s not the system’s fault. And he came to that understanding without you having to beat him over the head with his mistake.</p>
<p class="tx">Phil used precisely the same strategy in his interrogation of Lee. Clearly, he couldn’t let Lee off the hook, so he let the mind virus do its thing. When he told Lee that getting everything out on the table was the only way to fix the problem, he left it to Lee to put his own spin on whatever “fix” might mean. When he told him that Nate “knows you can do so much good for so many people, given the opportunity,” he let Lee decide whether that meant he still had a future with the Agency. When he suggested that “maybe your Foelandian friends took advantage of you,” it was up to Lee to decide where to take that.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">It’s important to be clear that while the process of building the monologue is, to some extent, a formulaic one, it is not one that allows for any sort of cookie-cutter approach. No doubt, some of the phrases we commonly use are applicable to just about any situation. But what you need to strictly avoid is employing any kind of plug-and-play technique, or creating a monologue that’s nothing but an amalgamation of sound bites. You need to customize the monologue to the individual and the situation you’re dealing with. That effort begins even before you transition into interrogation mode, by ensuring that you’re listening closely and assimilating what the person is saying during the interview. If he mentions in his response to one of your questions that his wife is expecting, or that he was recently laid off, or that money is tight because he has three kids in college, that information can be invaluable in helping you to craft customized rationalization statements that will strike a chord.</p>
<p class="tx">It’s also essential to be thoroughly informed about the case facts. In Phil’s interrogation of Lee, he capitalized on Lee’s friendship with Nate. The same strategy holds for any elicitation: The monologue you build needs to be constructed around whatever information you have about the individual.</p>
<p class="tx">Suppose you’re an office manager, and you’ve discovered that $50 is missing from the petty cash box. The timing and circumstances are such that it’s almost certain that Sally, an assistant bookkeeper, took the money. You know that she’s a single mom, and that she’s struggling to make ends meet. When you confront her, she denies knowing anything about the missing money. So what you convey to her might go something like this:</p>
<p class="tx">“Sally, as I was preparing to sit down to talk to you, one of the things that occurred to me, knowing what I know about you, is why would this happen to her? Why might she do something like this? You know, over the years, I’ve talked to a lot of people who do things for reasons that nobody can justify, or understand. But what if this is a totally different situation? For example, I ask myself, what if I were to go home one night, and my son and daughter looked up at me and said, ‘Mommy, what’s for dinner?’ And I’m confronted with the truth: There is no dinner. There’s nothing in the refrigerator. There’s nothing in the cabinets. There’s no money in my purse. There <span class="epub-i">is</span> no dinner. Would I do something I normally would never do, because now I have no choice? What if I was forced to make that decision? I’m very lucky, Sally. I don’t have to do that. The point I’m trying to make is that if you’ve been in those kinds of situations, we need to know that. We need to understand that. It still doesn’t necessarily turn an unfortunate decision into a good decision, but it helps us understand. Because we all make unfortunate decisions. We make them every day. But what’s important here is to help people understand <span class="epub-i">why</span> this happened.”</p>
<p class="tx">Nothing cookie-cutter about that. It speaks directly to Sally’s personal situation, and it’s presented in a way that will connect with her. Of course, it’s not always quite that easy. It’s one thing when the issue you’re dealing with is $50 missing from petty cash. But what if you were investigating an unspeakable crime? Customizing the monologue in those cases requires a lot of experience. Unless you’re in a position like that of a law enforcement officer who is routinely exposed to heinous crimes, or a psychologist who has worked with people who have all sorts of serious problems, it’s hard to imagine some of the things we as human beings are capable of. So it can be very difficult in those cases to create a monologue that’s more than a collection of standard sound bites. You can rationalize, minimize, and project the blame for anything, but for it to be meaningful it has to be consistent with the gravity and case facts of the situation. There has to be a base of rationalizations and defenses to draw upon in order to make the monologue relevant. So experience and training in those areas become essential.</p>
<p class="tx">The same fundamental idea is applicable to other, less intense situations. Let’s say you’re a human resources manager, and part of your job is to screen and interview job candidates. Over time, you’ll develop a sense of what people tend to lie about—how they might falsify their résumés, or embellish their education or skill level. So you’ll need to maintain a monologue base, and generate a repository of meaningful rationalizations and other information to draw from during the interview. If, for example, you work for a professional sports franchise, and you find that the candidates who apply for a public relations position tend to grossly exaggerate their list of professional contacts in that sport, you need to be able to manage that. You need to be prepared for that problem to crop up in the interview, because it’s critical that you gain an accurate picture of the connectedness of each candidate so you and the hiring manager can make the best hiring decision. If the issue arises, and you find you need to persuade the candidate to come clean on what his real level of connectedness is, it’ll be very helpful to have a rationalization to draw upon that will help him out. It might sound something like this:</p>
<p class="tx">“You know, what we’ve found in interviewing for this position is that a lot of people think they have to have some massive database of high-profile contacts in order to even be considered for the job, so they end up going a little over the top in how they portray their own situation. That’s perfectly understandable, because there’s a lot of misinformation and disinformation out there about what the expectations are. The truth is, that’s nowhere near the top of the list of what we’re looking for. We already have a robust contact database. The right person for this position is someone we can work with to exploit that database, and add to it over time. We want to be able to provide whatever support is needed, but to do that, it’s essential that we have a really accurate picture of what we’re working with. Without that, it’s very difficult to move forward in this process.”</p>
<p class="tx">Boom. You just made him see the light.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">The process of interviewing and interrogating children must be executed with extreme care. Children sometimes answer questions they don’t understand, and sometimes provide answers to questions without realizing they’re mistaken. Anyone who deals with children knows that the line between fantasy and reality is often blurred, and what we might consider to be a lie is not a lie in the mind of a child. The monologue must therefore be tailored in a way that takes those factors into account.</p>
<p class="tx">Michael was once contracted by a lawyer, whom we’ll call “Mr. Jones,” to interview a thirteen-year-old girl—let’s call her “Paulette”—who claimed to be a victim of severe abuse by members of a satanic cult when she was six years old. It was a particularly disturbing case. According to Paulette, she, along with sixty other children, were subjected to satanic rituals that included rape and torture at the hands of the leader of a satanic cult in California. Some children, Paulette claimed, had been murdered. Mr. Jones was investigating the possibility of filing a class-action lawsuit against the satanic cult, and he saw Paulette as the most credible voice among the children who had allegedly been harmed. Mr. Jones either truly believed Paulette’s story, or desperately wanted to believe it. So he hired Michael to interview her, with the expectation that he would find her to be truthful. That finding would greatly strengthen his case.</p>
<p class="tx">Going into the interview, Michael knew that he had at least three obstacles to overcome. First, Paulette had been interviewed multiple times by family members, police officers, therapists, and attorneys. Along the way, she had undoubtedly been subjected to leading and suggestive questions, and it likely was becoming more difficult by the day for Paulette to separate fantasy from reality. Was she reading their inadvertent signals and merely telling the interviewers what she believed they wanted to hear? Some of her interviewers may have deliberately distorted the issue for personal notoriety and profit, in light of the potential class-action lawsuit. Second, we know that the longer the span of time between an event and the disclosure of information about that event, the greater the likelihood that there will be problems in determining the truth of the matter. In Paulette’s young life, the seven years that elapsed between the event and the disclosure was an eternity. Third, interviewing children is a challenge in any case, but the fact that this case involved topics like satanic rituals, rape, torture, and murder made it extraordinarily sensitive.</p>
<p class="txs">Paulette’s story was both bizarre and horrific. As Michael listened to her account, he remained objective and nonjudgmental, recognizing that displaying any sort of emotion could influence her responses to his questions. Over the two days he spent with Paulette, he was struck by how strongly she appeared to believe her story. Was her display of credibility the result of her actual experience, or of having told the story repeatedly in a variety of settings, creating what she eventually thought of as a memory that she actually believed to be true? Let’s look at an excerpt from the transcript of the interview, in which only the names have been changed:</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> In your earlier statement, you said you were raped by Mr. X at his apartment in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> I don’t know if we had sex because he injected me with something and I can’t remember.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Did you see Mr. X stab the little boy with the tire iron in the underwater cave?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> It was Stan.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> In your earlier statement, you said it was Mr. X. Was it Stan or was it Mr. X that stabbed the little boy?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> Mr. X.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Why did you say Stan?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> I don’t know.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> How did you get to the cave?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> We flew in a helicopter to somewhere, I don’t know.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Where did the helicopter land?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> In a field and then we rode on a bus to the lake.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> You said you read a sign on a locked gate leading to the lake where the cave is located. You said the sign read, “No Trespassing,” right?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> You also said earlier that you hadn’t learned to read yet when you took that trip. How do you know the sign said “No Trespassing”?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> Once I learned to read, I knew that’s what the sign said.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Tell me about how you got to the underwater cave in the lake.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> We [Paulette and two other girls, ages four and six] changed into long T-shirts. They spent a few minutes teaching us how to scuba dive.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> How did they teach you?</p>
<p class="dias"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> We didn’t get into the water. We just stood on the shore and they put the scuba gear on us.</p>
<p class="dias">[Michael asked Paulette to draw a picture of the scuba gear they supposedly used. In her drawing, the children looked like they were about to be launched into space.]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Do you know how to swim?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Then what?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> Then we got into a rowboat with one adult and rowed out into the middle of the lake.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Were you wearing life jackets?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> When did you put on the scuba gear?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> We had it on when we got in the boat and we were breathing with our scuba gear on the way in the boat.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> When you got to the middle of the lake what happened?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> We all jumped in the water.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Who rowed the boat back to shore if there was only one adult in the boat?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> I guess there must have been two adults then.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Then what happened?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> Me and the youngest girl each took one of his hands and dove down into the water. He had a flashlight.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Then what happened?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> The other girl dove under the water with us and it took us about a minute and a half to reach the cave.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> If the adult was holding each of you by the hand and a flashlight, too, how did he swim?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> [Physically demonstrates the adult swimming underwater with both hands.]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Okay. Then what happened?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> We went down about twelve feet and there was a plastic cover that he pulled apart so we could swim into the cave.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Describe the cave for me.</p>
<p class="dias"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> Well, I don’t know. I guess it was one room with a dirt floor and a skylight.</p>
<p class="dias">[Michael walks Paulette through her gruesome description of satanic rituals, rape, torture, and murder.]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> How did you return from the cave?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> We swam to the surface, but the boat wasn’t there, so we all swam to shore.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> How did that work exactly?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> He held two of us with each hand and the littlest one swam on her own.</p>
<p class="stnis">By that point, Paulette’s inconsistent statements had made it clear to Michael that she wasn’t being truthful. It was time for Michael to switch into interrogation mode, and to begin his monologue.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Paulette, I’ve listened to your story over the last two days, and it’s obvious that something has been bothering you. I know Mr. Jones told you that my job is to know when people are telling the truth and when people are making up a story. I think what’s been bothering you is that some of the things you have been telling me aren’t completely true. But that’s okay, Paulette. I don’t want you to worry about that.</p>
<p class="diatx">You’ve been telling this story for a long time. If you tell a story long enough, you sometimes begin to believe it yourself. I think a little bit of that happened here. After a while, it just becomes part of who you are. I’m guessing that at first, you probably did this as a game to see how people would react. I don’t think you even expected people to believe you at first. But when people believed you, it made it very hard to say you were just playing around. It all started to get very confusing for you, and before you knew it, here I came to talk to you, and this thing got all blown up and out of control.</p>
<p class="diatx">You know, I almost have to laugh when I think about how crazy people started to get. It is kind of funny when you think about it. Yeah, I think you’d have to agree it got a little nuts, but I blame the adults involved in this, not you. When a lot of what you were saying really didn’t make sense, anyone with half a brain should have known you were just playing around. If I was you, I wouldn’t feel embarrassed about this because nobody got hurt.</p>
<p class="diatx">When I was a little kid, I remember trading a neighbor kid a stupid little stick for his toy stagecoach and horses.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> [Laughs]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> When I came home, my mom asked me where I got the stagecoach and horses. I told her I found it. She knew I was lying, but I thought if I told her the truth she would make me give the stagecoach back to the neighbor kid. After I finally told her the truth she told me that she understood, but that she thought I had taken advantage of the kid. She wanted me to do the right thing. It was hard, but I gave the stagecoach back, and my mom was proud of me. It’s funny that I still remember the good feeling I got from telling the truth and doing the right thing. Just like I did, you can do the right thing and tell the truth, too. I know you can.</p>
<p class="diatx">Paulette, you’re a good person and the last thing I want to do is make you feel bad or feel embarrassed. Trust me, I’ve been there myself, more than I care to admit. I’m not perfect, either. Do you have erasers on your pencils at school?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Paulette:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I know. That’s why they put erasers on pencils, because they know people make mistakes. I know people will understand, because I understand. Nobody is going to get mad at you. Before I leave today, I’ll help you talk to Mr. Jones and explain what’s going on. I know he’ll be pleased that we set the record straight before he files his papers with the court. It might seem a little uncomfortable at first, but you’re a brave young lady, and we’ll get through this together.</p>
