<p class="apau"><span class="epub-b1">Conducted by LAPD Detectives Philip Vannatter and Thomas Lange</span></p>
<p class="apdl"><span class="epub-b1">June 13, 1994</span></p>
<p class="tnis">NOTE: As you read through the transcript, consider the following questions:</p>
<p class="bp">• Had the detectives properly prepared for the interview?</p>
<p class="bp">• Did they come into the interview with a clear strategy and a goal they hoped to accomplish?</p>
<p class="bp">• Did they establish individual roles for themselves prior to the interview, and conduct the interview accordingly?</p>
<p class="bp">• Did they lock Simpson into a clear alibi?</p>
<p class="bp">• Were they able to get Simpson to commit to a specific timeline for his activities the night before, and particularly between the hours of nine and eleven, when investigators determined the murders were likely committed?</p>
<p class="bp">• Did they obtain a coherent reason for how Simpson sustained the wounds to his left hand?</p>
<p class="bp">• Did they properly explore and clarify contradictory statements?</p>
<p class="bp">• Did they focus on high-value questions, or did they become distracted by pursuing irrelevant and meaningless lines of inquiry?</p>
<p class="bp">• Did they waste precious time asking background questions that could easily have been addressed elsewhere?</p>
<p class="bp">• Did they display an appropriate demeanor, or were they overly deferential to Simpson?</p>
<p class="bp">• Did Simpson leave the interrogation room having learned more information about the case than the detectives learned from him?</p>
<p class="bp">• <span class="epub-i">Did they ask the most important question of all, whether he caused the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman?</span></p>

<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> … my partner, Detective Lange, and we’re in an interview room in Parker Center. The date is June 13, 1994, and the time is 13:35 hours and we’re here with O. J. Simpson. Is that Orenthal James Simpson?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Orenthal James Simpson.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> And what is your birth date, Mr. Simpson?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> July 9, 1947.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Okay, prior to us talking to you, as we agreed with your attorney, I’m going to give you your constitutional rights. And I would like you to listen carefully. If you don’t understand anything, tell me, okay?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> All right.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Okay, Mr. Simpson, you have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used in a court of law. You have the right to speak with an attorney and to have an attorney during the questioning. If you so desire and cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you without charge before questioning. Do you understand your rights?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Are there any questions about that?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> [Unintelligible]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Okay, you’ve got to speak louder than that.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Okay, no.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Okay, do you wish to give up your right to remain silent and talk to us?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Ah, yes.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Okay, and you give up your right to have an attorney present while we talk?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Mmm-hmm. Yes.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Okay. All right, what we’re gonna do is, we want to, we’re investigating, obviously, the death of your ex-wife and another man.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Someone told us that.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Yeah, and we’re going to need to talk to you about that. Are you divorced from her now?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> How long have you been divorced?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Officially? Probably close to two years, but we’ve been apart for a little over two years.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Have you?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What was your relationship with her? What was the …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Well, we tried to get back together, and it just didn’t work—it wasn’t working. So we both were going our separate ways.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Recently you tried to get back together?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> We tried to get back together for about a year, you know, where we started dating each other and seeing each other. She came back and wanted us to get back together, and …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Within the last year, you’re talking about?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> She came back about a year and four months ago about us trying to get back together, and we gave it a shot. We gave it a shot the better part of a year. And I think we both knew it wasn’t working, and probably three weeks ago or so we said it just wasn’t working, and we went our separate ways.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Okay, the two children are yours?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> She have custody?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> We have joint custody.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Through the courts?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> We went through the courts and everything. Everything is done. We have no problems with the kids, we do things together, you know, with the kids.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> How was your separation? Was that a …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> The first separation?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Yeah, was there problems with that?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> For me, it was big problems. I loved her, I didn’t want us to separate.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Uh-huh. I understand that she had made a couple of crime … crime reports or something?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Ah, we had a big fight about six years ago on New Year’s, you know, she made a report. I didn’t make a report. And then we had an altercation about a year ago maybe. It wasn’t a physical argument. I kicked her door or something.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> And she made a police report on those two occasions?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Mmm-hmm. And I stayed right there until the police came, talked to them.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Were you arrested at one time for something?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No. I mean, five years ago we had a big fight, six years ago, I don’t know. I know I ended up doing community service.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> So you weren’t arrested?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, I was never really arrested.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> They never booked you in?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Can I ask you, when’s the last time you’ve slept?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I got a couple of hours’ sleep last night. I mean, you know, I slept a little on the plane, not much, and when I got to the hotel I was asleep a few hours when the phone call came.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Did Nicole have a housemaid that lived there?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I believe so, yes.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Do you know her name at all?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Avia … Alvia, something like that.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> We didn’t see her there. Did she have the day off, perhaps?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I don’t know. I don’t know what schedule she’s on.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Phil, what do you think? We can maybe just recount last night.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Yeah. When was the last time you saw Nicole?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> We were leaving a dance recital. She took off and I was talking to her parents.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Where was the dance recital?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Paul Revere High School.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> And was that for one of your children?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> For my daughter Sydney.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> And what time was that yesterday?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> It ended about six-thirty, quarter to seven, something like that, you know in the ballpark, right in that area. And they took off.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> They?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Her and her family, her mother and father, sisters, my kids, you know.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> And then you went your own separate ways?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, actually she left, and then came back and her mother got in a car with her, and the kids all piled into her sister’s car, and they …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Was Nicole driving?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What kind of car was she driving?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Her black car, a Cherokee, a Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What were you driving?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> My Rolls-Royce … my Bentley, rather.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Do you own that Ford Bronco that sits outside?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Hertz owns it and Hertz lets me use it.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> So that’s your vehicle, the one that was parked there on the street?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> And it’s actually owned by Hertz?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Hertz, yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Who’s the primary driver on that? You?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I drive it, the housekeeper drives it, you know, it’s kind of a …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> All-purpose type vehicle?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah—it’s the only one that my insurance will allow me to let anyone else drive.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> When you drive it, where do you park it at home?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> It depends …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Where it is now, it was in the street or something?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I always park it on the street.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> You never take it in the …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Oh, rarely. I mean, I’ll bring it in and switch the stuff, you know, and stuff like that. I did that yesterday, you know.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> When did you last drive it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yesterday.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What time yesterday?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> In the morning, in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Okay, you left her, you’re saying, about six-thirty or seven, or she left the recital?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> And you spoke with her parents?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, we were just sitting there talking.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What time did you leave the recital?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Right about that time. We were all leaving. We were all leaving then. Her mother said something about me joining them for dinner and I said no thanks.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Where did you go from there, O.J.?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Ah, home, home for a while, got my car for a while, tried to find my girlfriend for a while, came back to the house.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Who was home when you got home?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Kato.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Kato? Anybody else? Was your daughter there, Arnelle?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Isn’t that her name, Arnelle?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Arnelle, yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> So what time do you think you got back home, actually physically got home?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Seven-something.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Seven-something? And then you left, and …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, I’m trying to think, did I leave? You know I’m always … I had to run and get my daughter some flowers. I was actually doing the recital, so I rushed and got her some flowers, and I came home, and then I called Paula as I was going to her house, and Paula wasn’t home.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Paula is your girlfriend?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Girlfriend, yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Paula who?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Barbieri.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Could you spell that for me?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> B-A-R-B-I-E-R-I.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Do you know an address on her?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, she lives on Wilshire, but I think she’s out of town.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> You got a phone number?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, of course … [telephone number redacted].</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> So you didn’t see her last night?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, we’d been to a big affair the night before, and then I came back home. I was basically at home. I mean, anytime I was … whatever time it took me to get to the recital and back, to get to the flower shop and back, I mean, that’s the time I was out of the house.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Were you scheduled to play golf this morning, someplace?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> In Chicago.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What kind of a tournament was it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Ah, it was Hertz, with special clients.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Oh, okay. What time did you leave last night, leave the house?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> To go to the airport?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> About … the limo was supposed to be there at ten-forty-five. Normally, they get there a little earlier. I was rushing around, somewhere between there and eleven o’clock.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> So approximately ten-forty-five to eleven?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Eleven o’clock, yeah, somewhere in that area.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> And you went by limo?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Who’s the limo service?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Ah, you’d have to ask my office.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Did you converse with the driver at all? Did you talk to him?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, he was a new driver. Normally, I have a regular driver I drive with and converse. No, just about rushing to the airport, about how I live my life on airplanes, and hotels, that type of thing.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> What time did your plane leave?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Ah, eleven-forty-five the flight took off.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What airline was it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> American.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> American? And it was eleven-forty-five to Chicago?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Chicago.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> So yesterday you did drive the white Bronco?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> And where did you park it when you brought it home?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Ah, the first time probably by the mailbox. I’m trying to think, or did I bring it in the driveway? Normally, I will park it by the mailbox, sometimes …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> On Ashford, or Ashland?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> On Ashford, yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Where did you park yesterday for the last time, do you remember?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Right where it is.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Where is it now?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Where, on …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Right on the street there.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> On Ashford?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, on Rockingham.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> You parked it there?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> About what time was that?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Eight-something, seven … eight, nine o’clock, I don’t know, right in that area.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Did you take it to the recital?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> What time was the recital?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Over at about six-thirty. Like I said, I came home, I got my car, I was going to see my girlfriend. I was calling her, and she wasn’t around.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> So you drive the, you came home in the Rolls, and then you got in the Bronco?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> In the Bronco ’cause my phone was in the Bronco. And because it’s a Bronco. It’s a Bronco, it’s what I drive, you know. I’d rather drive it than any other car. And, you know, as I was going over there I called her a couple of times, and she wasn’t there, and I left a message, and then I checked my messages, and there were no messages. She wasn’t there, and she may have to leave town. Then I came back and ended up sitting with Kato.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Okay. What time was this again that you parked the Bronco?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Eight-something, maybe. He hadn’t done a Jacuzzi, we had … went and got a burger, and I’d come home and kind of leisurely got ready to go. I mean we’d done a few things.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> You weren’t in a hurry when you came back with the Bronco?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> The reason I ask you, the car was parked kind of at a funny angle, stuck out in the street.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Well, it’s parked because … I don’t know if it’s a funny angle or what. It’s parked because when I was hustling at the end of the day to get all my stuff, and I was getting my phone and everything off it, when I just pulled it out of the gate there, it’s like, it’s a tight turn.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> So you had it inside the compound, then?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Oh, okay.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I brought it inside the compound to get my stuff out of it, and then I put it out, and I’d run back inside the gate before the gate closed.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> How did you get the injury on your hand?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I don’t know. The first time, when I was in Chicago and all, but at the house I was just running around.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> How did you do it in Chicago?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I broke a glass. One of you guys had just called me, and I was in the bathroom, and I just kind of went bonkers for a little bit.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Is that how you cut it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Mmm, it was cut before, but I think I just opened it again, I’m not sure.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Do you recall bleeding at all in your truck, in the Bronco?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I recall bleeding at my house, and then I went to the Bronco. The last thing I did before I left, when I was rushing, was went and got my phone out of the Bronco.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Mmm-hmm. Where’s the phone now?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> In my bag.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> You have it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> In that black bag.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> You brought a bag with you here?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Do you recall bleeding at all?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, I mean, I know I was bleeding, but it was no big deal. I bleed all the time. I play golf and stuff, so there’s always something, nicks and stuff, here and there.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> So did you do something? When did you put the Band-Aid on it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Actually, I asked the girl this morning for it.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> And she got it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, ’cause last night with Kato, when I was leaving, he was saying something to me, and I was rushing to get my phone, and I put a little thing on it, and it stopped.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Do you have the keys to the Bronco?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Okay. We’ve impounded the Bronco. I don’t know if you know that or not.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> To take a look at it. Other than you, who’s the last person to drive it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Probably Gigi. When I’m out of town, I don’t know who drives the car, maybe my daughter, maybe Kato.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> The keys are available?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I leave the keys there, you know, when Gigi’s there, because sometimes she needs it, or Gigi was off and wasn’t coming back until today, and I was coming back tonight.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> So you don’t mind if Gigi uses it, or …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> This is the only one I can let her use. When she doesn’t have her car, ’cause sometimes her husband takes her car, I let her use the car.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> When was the last time you were at Nicole’s house?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I don’t go in, I don’t go in her house. I haven’t been in her house in a week, maybe five days. I go to her house a lot. I mean, I’m always dropping the kids off, picking the kids up, fooling around with the dog, you know.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> How does that usually work? Do you drop them at the porch, or do you go in with them?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, I don’t go in the house.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Is there a kind of gate out front?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> But you never go inside the house?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Up until five days, six days ago, I haven’t been in the house. Once I started seeing Paula again, I kind of avoid Nicole.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Is Nicole seeing anybody else that you …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I have no idea. I really have absolutely no idea. I don’t ask her, I don’t know. Her and her girlfriends, they go out, you know, they’ve got some things going on right now with her girlfriends, so I’m assuming something’s happening because one of her girlfriends is having a big problem with her husband because she’s always saying she’s with Nicole until three or four in the morning. She’s not. You know, Nicole tells me she leaves here at one-thirty or two or two-thirty, and the girl doesn’t get home until five, and she only lives a few blocks away.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Something’s going on, huh?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Do you know where they went, the family, for dinner last night?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No. Well, no, I didn’t ask.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> I just thought maybe there’s a regular place they go.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No. If I was with them, we’d go to Toscano [Toscana]. I mean, not Toscano, Poponi’s [Peppone].</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> You haven’t had any problems with her lately, have you, O.J.?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I always have problems with her, you know. Our relationship has been a problem relationship. Probably lately for me, and I say this only because I said it to Ron yesterday at the—Ron Fishman, whose wife is Cora—at the dance recital, when he came up to me and went “Oooh, boy, what’s going on?” And everybody was beefing with everybody, and I said, “Well I’m just glad I’m out of the mix.” You know, because I was like dealing with him and his problems with his wife and Nicole and evidently some new problems that a guy named Christian was having with his girl and was staying at Nicole’s house, and something was going on, but I don’t think it’s pertinent to this.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Did Nicole have words with you last night?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Pardon me?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Did Nicole have words with you last night?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Did you talk to her last night?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> To ask to speak to my daughter, to congratulate my daughter, and everything.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> But you didn’t have a conversation with her?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What were you wearing last night, O.J.?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> What I wore, I wore on the golf course yesterday, some of these kind of pants, some of these kind of pants, I mean I changed different for the whatever it was. I just had on some …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Just these black pants.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Just these … they’re called Bugle Boy.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Bugle Boy? Is that what you wore to the recital?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, to the recital I wore … what did I wear to the recital? I wore a white T-shirt and some slacks.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> These aren’t the pants?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Where are the pants that you wore?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> They’re hanging in my closet.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> These are washable, right? You just throw them in the laundry?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, I got a hundred pair. They give them to me free, Bugle Boy, so I’ve got a bunch of them.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Do you recall coming home and hanging them up, or …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I always hang up my clothes. I mean it’s rare that I don’t hang up my clothes unless I’m laying them in my bathroom for her to do something with them. But those are the only things I don’t hang up. But when you play golf you don’t necessarily dirty pants.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> What kind of shoes were you wearing?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Tennis shoes.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Tennis shoes? Do you know what kind?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Probably Reebok, that’s all I wear.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Are they at home, too?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Was this just to be a short trip to Chicago, so you didn’t take a whole lot?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, I was coming back today.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Just overnight?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> That’s a hectic schedule, drive back here to play golf and come back.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, but I do it all the time.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Do you?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah. That’s what I was complaining with the driver about, you know, about my whole life is on and off airplanes.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> O.J., we’ve got sort of a problem.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> We’ve got some blood on and in your car, we’ve got some blood at your house, and it’s sort of a problem.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Well, take my blood—test it.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Well, we’d like to do that. We’ve got, of course the cut on your finger that you aren’t real clear on. Do you recall having that cut on your finger the last time you were at Nicole’s house?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> [Pause] A week ago?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, it was last night.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Okay, so it was last night you cut it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Somewhere after the recital?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Somewhere when I was rushing to get out of my house.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Okay, after the recital?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What do you think happened? Do you have any idea?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I have no idea, man. You guys haven’t told me anything. I have no idea what happened. When you said to my daughter, who said something to me today, that somebody else might have been involved. I have absolutely no idea what happened. I don’t know how, why, or what. I mean, you guys haven’t told me anything. Every time I ask you guys, you say you’re going to tell me in a bit.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Well, we don’t know a lot of the answers to these questions yet ourselves, O.J., okay?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I’ve got a bunch of guns, guns all over the place. You can take them, they’re all there, I mean, you can see them. I keep them in my car for an incident that happened a month ago that my in-laws, my wife and everybody knows about that.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What was that?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Going down to … and cops down there know about it because I’ve told two marshals about it at a mall. I was going down for a christening, and I had just left our set and it was like three-thirty in the morning and I am in a lane, and all of a sudden the car in front of me is going real slow, and I’m slowing down ’cause I figure he sees a cop, ’cause we were all going pretty fast and I’m going to change lanes, but there’s a car next to me and I can’t change lanes. Then that goes for a while, and I’m going to slow down and go around him, but the car butts up to me and I’m like caught between three cars. They were Oriental guys, and they were not letting me go anywhere. And finally I went on the shoulder, and I sped up, and then I held my phone up so they could see the light part of it, you know, ’cause I have tinted the windows, and they kind of scattered, and I chased one of them for a while to make him think I was chasing him before I took off.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Were you in the Bronco?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> What were you driving?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> My Bentley. It has tinted windows and all, so I figured they thought they had a nice little touch.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Did you think they were trying to rip you off?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Definitely, they were. And then the next day, you know, Nicole and I, I went home. At four in the morning I got there to Laguna, and when we woke up, I told her about it, and told her parents about it, told everybody about it, you know? And when I saw two marshals at a mall, I walked up and told them about it.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What did they do, make a report on it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> They didn’t know nothing. I mean, they’ll remember me and remember I told them.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Did Nicole mention that she’d been getting any threats lately to you? Anything she was concerned about or the kids’ safety?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> To her?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> From?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> From anybody?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Was she very security-conscious? Did she keep that house locked up?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Very.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> The intercom didn’t work apparently, right?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I thought it worked.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Oh, okay. Does the electronic buzzer work?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> The electronic buzzer works to let people in.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Do you ever park in the rear when you go over there?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Most of the time.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> You do park in the rear?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Most times when I’m taking the kids there, I come right into the driveway, blow the horn, and she, or a lot of times the housekeeper, either the housekeeper opens or they’ll keep a garage door open up on the top of the thing, you know, but that’s when I’m dropping the kids off, and I’m not going in, and sometimes I go to the front because the kids have to hit the buzzer and stuff.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Did you say before that up until about three weeks ago you guys were going out again and trying to …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, we’d been going out for about a year, and then the last six months it hadn’t been working so we tried various things to see if we could make it work. We started trying to date and that wasn’t working, and so, you know, we just said the hell with it, you know.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> And that was about three weeks ago?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, about three weeks ago.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> So were you seeing her up to that point?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> It’s, to say I was seeing her, yeah, I mean yeah, yeah it was a done deal, it just wasn’t happening. I mean, I was gone. I mean, I was in San Juan doing a film, and I don’t think we had sex since I’ve been back from San Juan, and that was like two months ago. So it’s been like … for the kids we tried to do things together. We didn’t go out together, you know, we didn’t really date each other. Then we decided let’s try to date each other. We went out one night, and it just didn’t work.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> When you say it didn’t work, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Ah, the night we went out it was fun. Then the next night we went out it was actually when I was down in Laguna, and she didn’t want to go out. And I said, “Well, let’s go out ’cause I came all the way down here to go out,” and we kind of had a beef. And it just didn’t work after that, you know? We were only trying to date to see if we could bring romance back into our relationship. We just said, let’s treat each other like boyfriend and girlfriend instead of, you know, like seventeen-year-old married people. I mean, seventeen years together, whatever that is.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> How long were you together?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Seventeen years.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Seventeen years. Did you ever hit her, O.J.?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Ah, one night we had a fight. We had a fight and she hit me. And they never took my statement, they never wanted to hear my side and they never wanted to hear the housekeeper’s side. Nicole was drunk. She did her thing, she started tearing up my house, you know? And I didn’t punch her or anything, but I …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Slapped her a couple of times?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, no I wrestled her, is what I did. I didn’t slap her at all. I mean, Nicole’s a strong girl. She’s a … one of the most conditioned women. Since that period of time, she’s hit me a few times, but I’ve never touched her after that and I’m telling you, it’s five, six years ago.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What’s her birthday?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> May 19th.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Did you get together with her on her birthday?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, her and I and the kids, I believe.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Did you give her a gift?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I gave her a gift.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> What’d you give her?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I gave her either a bracelet or the earrings.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Did she keep them or …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Oh, no, when we split she gave me both the earrings and the bracelet back. I bought her a very nice bracelet, I didn’t know if it was Mother’s Day or her birthday, and I bought her the earrings for the other thing, and when we split, and it’s a credit to her, she felt that it wasn’t right that she had it, and I said good, because I want them back.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Was that the very day of her birthday, May 19th, or was it a few days later?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> You gave it to her on the 19th of May, her birthday, right, this bracelet?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I may have given her the earrings. No, the bracelet. May 19th. When was Mother’s Day?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Mother’s Day was around that …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, it was probably her birthday, yes.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> And did she return it the same day?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Oh, no, she … I’m in a funny place here on this, all right? She returned it—both of them—maybe three weeks ago or so. When I say I’m in a funny place on this, I gave it to my girlfriend and told her I bought it for her, you know? That was three weeks ago. I told her I bought it for her. What am I going to do with it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Did Mr. Weitzman, your attorney, talk to you anything about this polygraph we brought up before? What are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Should I talk about my thoughts on that?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> It’s up to you.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I’m sure eventually I’ll do it, but it’s like I’ve got some weird thoughts now. I’ve had weird thoughts … you know when you’ve been with a person for seventeen years, you think everything. I’ve got to understand what this thing is. If it’s true blue, I don’t mind doing it.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Well, you’re not compelled at all to take this, number one, and number two, I don’t know if Mr. Weitzman explained it to you—this goes to the exclusion of someone as much as to the inclusion so we can eliminate people. And just to get things straight …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> But does it work for elimination?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Oh, yes. We use it for elimination more than anything.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Well, I’ll talk to him about it.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Understand, the reason we’re talking to you is because you’re the ex-husband.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I know I’m the number one target, and now you tell me I’ve got blood all over the place.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Well, there’s blood in your house and in the driveway, and we’ve got a search warrant, and we’re going to get the blood. We found some in your house. Is that your blood that’s there?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> If it’s dripped, it’s what I dripped running around trying to leave.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Last night?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah, and I wasn’t aware that it was … I was aware that I … you know I was trying to get out of the house, I didn’t even pay any attention to it. I saw it when I was in the kitchen, and I grabbed a napkin or something, and that was it. I didn’t think about it after that.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> That was last night after you got home from the recital, when you were rushing?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> That was last night when I was … I don’t know what I was, I was in the car getting my junk out of the car. I was in the house throwing hangers and stuff in my suitcase. I was doing my little crazy what I do, I mean, I do it everywhere. Anybody who has ever picked me up says that O.J.’s a whirlwind. He’s running, he’s grabbing things, and that’s what I was doing.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> Well, I’m going to step out and I’m going to get a photographer to come down and photograph your hand there. And then here pretty soon we’re going to take you downstairs and get some blood from you. Okay? I’ll be right back.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> So it was about five days ago you last saw Nicole? Was it at the house?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Okay, the last time I saw Nicole, physically saw Nicole, I saw her obviously last night. The time before, I’m trying to think. I went to Washington, D.C., so I didn’t see her, so I’m trying to think. I haven’t seen her since I went to Washington. I went to Washington—what’s the day today?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Today’s Monday, the 13th of June.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Okay, I went to Washington on maybe Wednesday. Thursday, I think I was in … Thursday I was in Connecticut, then Long Island Thursday afternoon and all of Friday. I got home Friday night, Friday afternoon, I played, you know … Paula picked me up at the airport. I played golf Saturday, and when I came home I think my son was there. So I did something with my son. I don’t think I saw Nicole at all then. And then I went to a big affair with Paula Saturday night, and I got up and played golf Sunday, which pissed Paula off, and I saw Nicole at … it was about a week before, I saw her at the …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Okay, the last time you saw Nicole, was that at her house?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I don’t remember. I wasn’t in her house, so it couldn’t have been at her house, so it was, you know, I don’t physically remember the last time I saw her. I may have seen her even jogging one day.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Let me get this straight. You’ve never physically been inside the house?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Not in the last week.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Ever. I mean, how long has she lived there? About six months?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Oh, Christ, I’ve slept at that house many, many, many times, you know? I’ve done everything at that house, you know? I’m just saying … you’re talking in the week or so.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> Well, whatever. Six months she’s lived there?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I don’t know. Roughly. I was at her house maybe two weeks ago, ten days ago. One night her and I had a long talk, you know, about how can we make it better for the kids, and I told her we’d do things better. And, okay, I can almost say when that was. That was when I, I don’t know, it was about ten days ago. And then we … the next day I had her leave her dog, do a flea bath or something with me. Oh, I’ll tell you, I did see her one day I went … I don’t know if this was the early part of last week, I went ’cause my son had to go get something, and he ran in, and she came to the gate, and the dog ran out, and her friend Faye and I went looking for the dog. That may have been a week ago, I don’t know.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange (to Vannatter):</span> Got a photographer coming?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Vannatter:</span> No, we’re going to take him up there.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Lange:</span> We’re ready to terminate this at 14:07.</p>
