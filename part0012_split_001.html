<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_0">CONVINCING STATEMENTS</h2>

<p class="tni">Convincing statements are statements that are made to influence or manipulate perception, and they’re extraordinarily powerful. Their power lies in the fact that they’re either true, or they’re irrefutable. Let’s go back to Chapter 3, and the case of the missing oxycodone tablets. You’ve switched into interrogation mode with Jan, the pharmacy technician who, the case facts show, is responsible for the theft. You’re well into your monologue when suddenly Jan cuts you off. “Wait a minute,” she says, and in the same breath she launches into her argument:</p>
<p class="tx">“This doesn’t make any sense. I’ve been working here for six years, and I’ve never, ever been accused of doing anything wrong. I’ve trained most of the other techs, and they respect me. I’m just not the type of person who would do something like that. Why would I risk my job for some damn oxycodone?”</p>
<p class="tx">Jan wants to persuade you that you’re barking up the wrong tree, and her game plan is to accomplish that by painting herself with a halo. Everything she said was either true—she did indeed train most of the other techs, and they do indeed respect her—or irrefutable—whether or not she’s the type of person who would do something like that is yet to be determined. Those convincing statements are powerful because they’re so, well, <span class="epub-i">convincing</span>. You can even imagine yourself saying something like that if <span class="epub-i">you</span> were falsely accused of the theft. The difference is that in all likelihood, while you might find yourself making one of these statements during the exchange, your focus would be on making the point that you didn’t do it, rather than on coming up with a raft of convincing statements as a means of painting that halo.</p>
<p class="tx">So when you hear those statements from Jan, you need to recognize them for what they are, and sap their power by neutralizing them. The way to do that is to simply agree with them: “Jan, listen, you’re exactly right—everyone in the store knows how hard you work. I’m always hearing the other techs say how helpful you are, and you’ve certainly been very helpful to me over the years.”</p>

<p class="bh"><span class="epub-b1">USING AGREEMENT TO NEUTRALIZE CONVINCING STATEMENTS</span></p>
<p class="bbp">•    By agreeing with Jan, you’ve conveyed that you have, without question, heard what she just told you.</p>
<p class="bbp">•    Your reaction seems counterintuitive to her, in the sense that her purpose is to put up resistance, and yet you suddenly seem to be on her side. For a moment, she thinks she may have convinced you.</p>
<p class="bbp">•    When you return to your monologue, she’s likely thinking, <span class="epub-i">Oh, my God, it didn’t work.</span></p>
<p class="bbp">•    The recognition that that tack was ineffective puts her on the spot, and she has to try to figure out what to do now. She may be thinking that giving you at least <span class="epub-i">some</span> truthful information has become an option.</p>
<p class="bbp">•    You’ve disarmed her by taking away one of her most powerful weapons. Absent any others, she’s more inclined to listen to what you’re saying. Without realizing it, she has just stepped onto the slippery slope of short-term thinking.</p>

<hr class="calibre4"/>
<p class="tx"> </p>
<p class="tx">And then you go right back into your monologue:</p>
<p class="tx">“That’s why it’s so important that we resolve this, so we can get on with the business of doing what we do so well, and what so many people depend on us to do. They don’t look to us to sit in judgment of anyone, and none of us should have any inclination to do that. We just need to figure out why this happened, and fix it so we can go back to helping people.”</p>
<p class="tx">Jan recognizes that her game plan didn’t pan out the way she hoped it would. Trying to persuade you by influencing your perception of her got her nowhere. She has no choice but to abandon that tack.</p>
