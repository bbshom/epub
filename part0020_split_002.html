<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_1">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND ONLINE RESEARCH</h2>

<p class="tni">The second area of preparation involves collecting as much information as you can so you know the party you’re dealing with inside and out.</p>
<p class="tx">A law school mentor of mine in England, Professor John Murdoch, told me that to be really good as a negotiator or an advocate, I needed not only to know the facts of my case, but also to be able to step into the shoes of the other party and know the facts of his case, as well as his perspective of his own case, and of mine. I have carried that advice with me, and I’ve found it has broad application in many arenas.</p>
<p class="tx">How effective would an interrogator be if he didn’t understand the religious, political, or ideological motivations of the person he was tasked to interrogate? That background information is crucial fodder for the construction of an effective monologue. Similarly, how successful would a negotiator likely be if she didn’t understand what interest the other party was attempting to serve in making his demands?</p>
<p class="tx">For a number of years I have worked in the field of threat management, with a concentration in the area of higher education. The aim is to collect information that can be used to prevent people from harming others, harming themselves, or harming property. A key skill in threat management, as in litigation and negotiation, is the ability to quickly, ethically, and effectively collect information about individuals who may pose a threat. My good friend and colleague, Dr. Jeff Pollard, a highly regarded clinical psychologist and expert in threat management, uses a wonderful phrase to describe the process of creating an assessment of an individual: “Before we can <span class="epub-i">connect</span> the dots, first we have to <span class="epub-i">collect</span> the dots.”</p>
<p class="txs">There are several key places to look in the process of collecting those dots. They include, but are not limited to, the following: • Criminal records</p>
<p class="apbl">• Civil judgment records • Sex offender registries • Credit records (subject to appropriate authorization) • Tax records</p>
<p class="apbl">• Real estate transfer and ownership records • Social media presence In the social media category, there are a number of Web sites that are especially helpful resources in providing background information on individuals. I’ve worked with two highly respected colleagues in the threat management field, Dr. Marisa Randazzo and Dr. Gene Deisinger, to put together a list of sites that indicate how individuals are represented, and how they represent themselves, online. Working with students has taught me that it’s important to cast the net more widely than a lot of people would expect. Younger people have a presence on many social media sites that many older people have never even heard of. So, as you seek out information, ask questions of others about where you should be looking online.</p>
<p class="txs">The sites we use as resources include: • <a href="http://Archive.org" class="calibre2">Archive.org</a></p>
<p class="apbl">• Avvo</p>
<p class="apbl">• Blogger</p>
<p class="apbl">• Craigslist (search relevant city/town) • Facebook</p>
<p class="apbl">• Foursquare</p>
<p class="apbl">• FriendsReunited</p>
<p class="apbl">• Google/Yahoo!/Bing (search engines through which you should search for names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) • Google+</p>
<p class="apbl">• Instagram</p>
<p class="apbl">• LinkedIn</p>
<p class="apbl">• MySpace</p>
<p class="apbl">• Ning</p>
<p class="apbl">• Pheed</p>
<p class="apbl">• Pinterest</p>
<p class="apbl">• RateMyProfessors</p>
<p class="apbl">• Reddit</p>
<p class="apbl">• Snopes</p>
<p class="apbl">• Technorati (searches blogs) • Tumblr</p>
<p class="apbl">• Twitter</p>
<p class="apbl">• Vine</p>
<p class="apbl">• WordPress</p>
<p class="apbl">• Xanga</p>
<p class="apbl">• YouTube</p>
<p class="stx">The information that we collect from these online searches, in addition to what we’re able to glean from simply talking to people, can be invaluable in creating an accurate portrayal of the kind of person or company we’re dealing with. No interview, elicitation, or negotiation situation should ever be entered without having as much relevant background information as you can possibly gather on the person sitting across from you. Failure to gather that information can undermine your effectiveness and make your desired outcome—be it the truth, a favorable settlement, or a great deal—far more difficult to secure.</p>
