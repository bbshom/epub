<p class="tni"><span class="epub-b">Anchoring</span> – A term used in the negotiation context to describe a person’s heavy reliance on the first piece of information provided or offer made by the other party, creating an expectation of an outcome other than what was first envisaged.</p>
<p class="tni"><span class="epub-b">Anchor point</span> – Any part of the body that anchors a person to a particular spot or position, including the feet, which are always anchor points. We look at anchor point movement as a potential nonverbal deceptive behavior in which anxiety is dissipated through the physical movement.</p>
<p class="tni"><span class="epub-b">Attack behavior</span> – A verbal deceptive behavior in which a person attacks the questioner as a means of compelling him to back off from a particular line of questioning. This often takes the form of attempting to impeach the credibility or competence of the questioner. Example: “How long have you been doing this job?”</p>
<p class="tni"><span class="epub-b">Autonomic nervous system</span> – The part of the nervous system that controls the functions of body organs and involuntary physical reactions to stimuli.</p>

<p class="tni"><span class="epub-b">Cliff moment</span> – The arrival at a point when a person feels he has disclosed everything he is able to disclose without suffering negative consequences. To go further would be tantamount to “jumping off the cliff.”</p>

<p class="tni"><span class="epub-b">Denial behavior</span> – A category of verbal deceptive behavior in which a person appears to have a problem with denying an allegation. This can take the form of failing to deny the allegation altogether; providing a nonspecific denial (Example: “I would never do something like that”); or providing an isolated delivery of the denial by burying it in a long-winded answer.</p>
<p class="tni"><span class="epub-b">Direct observation of concern (DOC)</span> – A transition statement that lies at the low end of the confidence spectrum.</p>

<p class="tni"><span class="epub-b">Inappropriate level of politeness</span> – A verbal deceptive behavior in which a person interjects an overly polite or unexpectedly kind or complimentary comment directed at the questioner when responding to a question.
