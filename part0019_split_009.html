<p class="apct"><span class="epub-b">SLOW AND STEADY ACROSS THE GOLDEN BRIDGE</span></p>
<p class="tni">The admonition to check your progress as part of a structured approach to an elicitation situation is just as applicable to business and personal negotiation scenarios. It’s essential to allow the person on the other side of the table to work with you in a manner that enables you to gather the information you need in order to assess his position at any point in the negotiation process.</p>
<p class="tx">Recall in my Chapter 5 commentary the case of Andrew and Dorothy, where we built Sun Tzu’s “golden bridge” by using a proposal by Andrew as the foundation in the equitable distribution proceeding. Just as a guilty suspect doesn’t necessarily plan to confess when he steps into the interrogation room, what Andrew had envisaged when he sat down at the negotiation table was likely a far cry from what he eventually agreed to. Getting there required patience and a systematic means of reading the situation.</p>
<p class="tx">Imagine what might have happened if, as soon as Andrew had committed to negotiate fairly as a demonstration of love for his wife and child, I had said, “Okay, then give them the house, sign a multiyear restraining order, and pay them a large lump sum of money.” Chances are, we would have gotten absolutely nowhere. Instead, we needed to proceed at a slow and steady pace, posing noncoercive questions: “What do you think would be fair?” “Would you consider doing this?” “Wouldn’t it be great for your son if you did that?” This is the negotiation equivalent of asking, “What else?” You continue to add foundation blocks for your golden bridge until you’ve done all you can do.</p>
<p class="tx">Be aware that it’s far too easy to pounce when you get the admission or concession you were seeking. More often than not, he shoots himself in the foot. When you see that your monologue is having a positive effect, proceed with care and ensure you’re not jumping the gun when you decide to check your progress. Let the person cross that golden bridge at his own pace, on his own accord. Trying to rush him across will almost certainly cause the bridge to collapse.</p>
