<p class="h" id="calibre_pb_1"><span class="epub-b">Lower your voice</span></p>
<p class="tni">Our experience has corroborated a great deal of research that has shown that as a control mechanism, a lower volume is much more effective than a higher volume. If you start yelling at someone, typically the natural reaction is twofold: First, he’ll probably yell back. Second, he’ll almost certainly tune you out, and that’s the worst thing that can happen. The first mistake he made was to allow you to talk. He doesn’t realize that you’ve stopped asking questions, and now you’re the one who’s doing the talking. The longer that goes on, the more it works to your advantage. To keep it going, it’s essential to stay low-key, and a voice that’s lowered a decibel or two aids that effort tremendously.</p>
<p class="tx">Keep in mind that as critical as the <span class="epub-i">content</span> of the monologue is, <span class="epub-i">delivery</span> trumps it—it’s that important. No matter how brilliant and compelling what you’re saying is, if it isn’t delivered effectively, the person you’re interrogating won’t even hear it. If your manner is harsh and overbearing, he’ll see you as an opponent, and he’ll be thinking of nothing but ways to fight you. You might as well be speaking a foreign language, because he’s translating whatever you’re saying as, “I’m out to get you.” The moment that happens, your job just got exponentially more difficult.</p>
<p class="tx">With your voice as your instrument of influence, your aim is to build and maintain whatever level of rapport you can in that situation. He may not like you, or like the position you represent. But all of a sudden, the way you’re talking to him, he’s likely thinking, “Wow, this isn’t what I was expecting at all. I expected to get brow-beaten.” You may still get some resistance, but if he sees you as someone who’s treating him respectfully and professionally, someone who’s objective rather than out to get him, someone who doesn’t appear to be an enemy, his resistance will be dampened significantly. The beautiful part is it’s all working to your advantage rather than to his, but he doesn’t know that.</p>

<p class="tni">When Phil began his monologue in his interrogation of Lee, the first two sentences after the DOC were these:</p>
<p class="tx">“Lee, this situation is somewhat awkward, I know. After all, you and Nate are really good friends, and have been for a long time.”</p>
<p class="tx">With that sympathetic sentiment, Phil was conveying to Lee that he got it. He could understand what Lee must be feeling, and he cared. There was certainly nothing extemporaneous about that sentiment, nor about the timing of it. It couldn’t have been more deliberate. An excellent rule of thumb is to make sure that the sentence immediately following the transition statement is a statement of sympathy or empathy. That way, the person hears right up front exactly what you want him to hear. Phil’s expression of sympathy primed the pump for Lee to receive the monologue in the right frame of mind.</p>
<p class="tx">At the point when Lee admitted that what he had been thinking about was “the Foelandians,” Phil jumped on the opportunity to convey an empathetic sentiment:</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ve always been fascinated by Foeland, too, and I’ve often thought about how incredible it would be to travel through the country, and to meet the people and see everything.”</p>
<p class="tx">Now, Phil not only sympathizes with Lee, he empathizes with him—he not only cares, but he has felt what Lee was feeling. We need to make it clear that this particular expression of empathy raises a point that warrants discussion: Phil’s statement wasn’t true. He’s never had any desire whatsoever to visit Foeland. The takeaway here is that what you say in your monologue needs to be relevant and believable, but not necessarily factual (we’ll explore this topic further in Chapter 9). Certainly, the truth stretching can never go so far as to promise something you can’t deliver as a means of eliciting a confession. But coming across as sincere is absolutely essential, and accomplishing that sometimes forces you to lie, especially when feeling any sense of genuine sincerity is simply impossible. Try to imagine, for example, that you had to interrogate a serial child molester. Phil doesn’t have to try to imagine it. He experienced it.</p>
<p class="tx">Early in his career, Phil had been called in to interview a U.S. government employee who held a senior managerial position as a GS-15. The man, whom we’ll call “Oscar,” was under investigation for child molestation. Phil had routinely been called upon to conduct interviews and interrogations of people who were accused of committing some of the most horrific crimes imaginable. It was part of the job, and it had to be done. But this one was especially tough.</p>
<p class="tx">The ongoing investigation of Oscar had not yielded any conclusive evidence against him. The problem was that Oscar had failed several polygraph examinations, because he was having trouble with standard questions about sexual deviancy. That process had isolated deception with respect to sexual activity involving children, and Oscar never budged from his adamant insistence that he had never engaged in any such activity.</p>
<p class="tx">Oscar knew very well why he had been instructed by the security department to meet with Phil, so there was no need for pretense. Phil reviewed the polygraph results with Oscar. Unruffled, and with characteristic calm, Phil asked the question that had to be asked: Had Oscar ever engaged in sexual activity involving children?</p>
<p class="tx">Oscar scowled. He wagged his finger at Phil, and with unmasked contempt, responded.</p>
<p class="tx">“Young man, I would never do that,” Oscar bristled, glaring at Phil. “That would be perverted, and I am not a pervert.”</p>
<p class="tx">Phil didn’t need to hear any more from Oscar. It was time for Oscar to do the listening, so Phil transitioned into interrogation mode.</p>
<p class="tx">“Oscar, it’s obvious from the consistent results we’re getting from our polygraph exams that there’s something you’re thinking about that involves sexual activity with children, and we need to talk about that so we can clear it up. Listen, I happen to have two little boys of my own. Quite frankly, if I thought you were a pervert, I don’t think I could stay in the same room with you. I couldn’t do it. But that’s not what this is about. This is about finding out what’s bothering somebody who’s been serving his country with distinction for a long time. Whatever it is that’s bothering you, Oscar, I guarantee you, it’s not the end of the world. If it were, we might as well all kiss the world good-bye, because we’ve all done things that we wish we hadn’t done, and that bother us when we think about them. Those things happen, Oscar, without anyone wanting to cause any harm. In these situations, what we often find is that stuff happens, and it happens to good people. What I mean by that is we have situations where bad people do bad things. But sometimes good people simply make the wrong decisions. They don’t intend to hurt anyone, they just end up going too far sometimes, not realizing what the consequences are, or that anyone is really being harmed. If that’s the case here, Oscar, we need to talk about it so we can fix it. You know, I’m not a psychiatrist, and I don’t pretend to be. But I do know that sometimes things happen in our lives, often when we’re young, that cause us to do things later in life that we have absolutely no control over. If we did, they would never have happened. I also know that we live in a crazy world, Oscar. I mean, everywhere you look, you’re bombarded with sex, and you can’t get away from it. That’s a social problem, and one that society has to fix. We can’t fix that, Oscar. But we <span class="epub-i">can</span> fix this, as long as we address it openly and honestly.”</p>
<p class="tx">It was going well. What Phil was saying was apparently resonating, because Oscar wasn’t putting up any resistance. Phil kept going, repeating the points he was making, and repeating them again. When the time came to test the water, Phil did so gently, and with no hint of derision or sanctimony.</p>
<p class="tx">“Oscar, I know all of this is very embarrassing to have to talk about. Nobody wants to be in a position of talking about things that are very, very personal. Talking about things involving children is especially embarrassing in the society we live in, there’s no question about that. But sometimes the situation involves children, and let’s face it, kids are everywhere. Now, when was the last time you were alone with any of these kids?”</p>
<p class="tx">The disturbing nature of the rest of the conversation was such that we certainly have no intention of subjecting anyone to it here. What we can say is that Oscar admitted to molesting hundreds of children. He even shared his favorite hangout when he was on the prowl: a popular pizza and arcade chain that catered to children.</p>
<p class="tx">Now, let’s go back to the beginning of Phil’s monologue, and look at what he said when he was addressing Oscar’s seething claim that he wasn’t a pervert:</p>
<p class="tx">“Listen, I happen to have two little boys of my own. Quite frankly, if I thought you were a pervert, I don’t think I could stay in the same room with you.”</p>
<p class="tx">That statement wasn’t entirely untrue. Phil did, in fact, have two little boys at the time. But the indication that he didn’t think Oscar was a pervert, and that he wouldn’t be able to sit in the same room with him if that were the case, was untrue. Phil thought Oscar was as perverted as they come, and being in the same room with him made his skin crawl. Still, he knew he had to neutralize Oscar’s attempt to convince him that he wasn’t a pervert so that Oscar would abandon that tack. The best way to do that was to agree with him, notwithstanding the untruthfulness of the statement. The moment Phil said that, Oscar lost a key play in his game plan, and he was put in the position of having to rethink his approach. And Phil was right there to help him figure it out.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">We’re occasionally asked a question about all of this that may have occurred to you, as well: Why don’t truly evil, coldhearted, hardened people, like Oscar, or perhaps a terrorist who senselessly kills innocent people, see this noncoercive approach as an indication of weakness or impotence that, far from compelling them to cooperate, encourages them toward what they perceive as an easy conquest?</p>
<p class="tx">Our response is to consider the underlying premise of the question. What, exactly, does it mean to be evil, coldhearted, and hardened? And to what extent is our own perception of those conditions authentic? To contend that those conditions equate to “I’m not going to cooperate or talk” is to impose our own logic—indeed, our own bias—on the behavior of another person. The truth is, human behavior isn’t necessarily logical, nor can it be expected to conform to our own expectations or biases. After all, what’s logical about molesting children? A psychologist at the Agency put it this way: There’s only a casual relationship between human behavior and logic. We simply cannot allow ourselves to assume that bad guys, or anyone else for that matter, will behave in a particular way under a particular circumstance. Our experience has borne that out, over and over again.</p>
<p class="tx">Susan Carnicero once conducted a screening interview with a job candidate we’ll call “Lucille,” who had acknowledged in a preliminary interview with one of Susan’s associates that she had had some drug problems in the past, but she stressed that she had long ago overcome them. When Susan met with her for the interview, Lucille arrived very casually dressed in a blue work shirt and blue jeans. The shirt had a logo on it, and as Susan proceeded with the interview, she found herself looking at the logo and trying to figure out what it was. It turned out to be the logo of the prison where Lucille had just finished serving time for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. She had to leave directly from the interview with Susan to check into a halfway house, where she was being assigned to help her continue her fight against drug addiction. The relationship between Lucille’s behavior and logic was even more casual than her interview attire.</p>
