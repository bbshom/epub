<p class="tni">(<span class="epub-i">Authors’ note: Due to the sensitive nature of the case we’re discussing in this chapter, the foreign country involved can’t be disclosed. We’ll refer to it by the fictitious name</span>, Foeland, <span class="epub-i">and to its citizens as</span> Foelandians.)</p>
<p class="tx">At the World Cup soccer games held in a picturesque city outside of the United States in the not-too-distant past, a stocky, bespectacled young man we’ll call “Lee” was hard at work. A specialist in Foelandian studies who was fluent in the language, Lee had been appointed as an interpreter for the Foelandian team. It was a demanding assignment, requiring round-the-clock availability for the duration of the event. That was fine with Lee—he valued the opportunity to put his skills to use in such a prestigious setting, and the simple truth was he enjoyed being around Foelandians. The time he spent with the soccer players and their Foelandian overseers was a valuable immersion opportunity that, for Lee, rivaled a visit to Foeland.</p>
<p class="tx">Not surprisingly, several of the Foelandian overseers were agents of the Foelandian Intelligence Service, or FIS. One of those agents, whom we’ll call “Otto,” had struck up an especially friendly relationship with Lee, and the two often talked about their families and what they hoped to do with their lives. One evening, as they were leaving the dorm that housed the team, Otto asked Lee about his plans for pursuing his Foelandian studies. Lee said his dream was to get a graduate degree, and he was torn between universities in the United States and in Foeland.</p>
<p class="tx">Lee eventually decided that since it was often difficult for foreigners to study in Foeland, he would opt for the United States. Before long, he was enrolled in a graduate program at a prestigious university that had a highly regarded Foelandian studies program. Shortly after he arrived, he met a fellow student, an American we’ll call “Nate,” and they quickly became good friends. When they finished their studies, they went their separate ways to pursue their careers. Lee returned to his home country, and was hired as a researcher and specialist in Foelandian studies. Nate went on to serve as a case officer with the CIA.</p>
<p class="tx">As the years passed, Nate and Lee stayed in touch, at least to the extent of sending the occasional greeting card. And then, just by chance, Nate was transferred to Lee’s home country. He reestablished contact with his friend, and soon learned that Lee’s research position gave him access to information that was of high interest to the U.S. government. Nate recognized the potential intelligence value of that connection, but he certainly didn’t want to do anything to jeopardize his friendship with Lee. He ultimately decided to approach Lee with the idea of becoming an asset for the Agency. When Lee proved to be open to the idea, Nate was both gratified by the potential intelligence coup, and relieved that his friendship with Lee was unharmed.</p>
<p class="tx">When the time came to bring Lee on board, the process of vetting him began. Phil was soon on a flight to Lee’s home country—it would be up to him to ensure that Lee was clean.</p>
<p class="tx">The plan was for Nate to arrange for Lee to arrive at a designated suite at a hotel in the country’s capital at six that evening. Phil and Nate got there early enough to ensure that they had plenty of time to check out the suite. They agreed it would be best for Nate to excuse himself after Lee arrived. Unfortunately for Nate, the only place available for him to wait it out was the bathroom.</p>
<p class="tx">“You can wait down in the lobby if you want,” Phil said. He was unsurprised when Nate declined. Nate was a good case officer, and Lee was his guy. There was no way he was leaving—he wanted at least to be able to hear what was going on. Phil stressed to Nate that he had to be as quiet as possible, because if Lee could hear him, he’d know the reverse was the case. If there was something Phil needed to elicit that Lee wanted to conceal, knowing his friend could hear would cause Lee to become that much more deeply entrenched in his concealment. If Nate had to flush the toilet, Phil instructed, fine. Other than that, silence. It was a fundamental tenet of the profession: Nobody confesses to a crowd.</p>
<p class="tx">Lee showed up right on time at six o’clock. Nate introduced him to Phil, and with this-is-how-we-do-it-all-the-time nonchalance, retired to the bathroom.</p>
<p class="tx">Phil and Lee took their seats. As Phil began the interview, he could see that Lee seemed nervous. While he took note of that fact, he knew that some degree of nervousness was natural under the circumstances, so he had no inclination to jump to any conclusions about what was causing it. Lee wasn’t exhibiting any deceptive behavior in response to Phil’s questions, and that’s what mattered. It was all going quite well, in fact, when Phil got to the question about whether Lee had ever worked for the bad guys.</p>
<p class="tx">“Lee, this next question is very important,” Phil said gently. “You’re willing to work for us—have you ever worked for any other foreign intelligence organization?”</p>
<p class="tx">Phil thought he’d seen it all. He hadn’t. Lee paused. Then he stood up, said, “No, sir,” and sat back down. He lowered his head and stared at the floor.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i">Are you kidding me?</span> Phil’s mind was reeling. It was as if this scholarly researcher had suddenly turned the clock back to the formal academic environment of his youth, and had been chastised by the headmaster. <span class="epub-i">What was that all about?</span></p>
<p class="tx">The answer, as always, lay somewhere on the best-case/worst-case continuum. In any event, it was weird. Lee and Nate were longtime friends, and now Phil had to determine what was up with Lee’s disturbing reaction to the “are you working for the bad guys” question. There was no doubt that Lee was troubled by the question, so it was time for Phil’s ideational fluency to kick in. He had a monologue to deliver, and he did so, calmly and reassuringly, beginning with a transition statement that took the form of a DOC.</p>
<p class="tx">“Lee, I know this isn’t an easy interview, by any means, and that some of the questions are very personal,” Phil said. “There’s clearly something that’s bothering you, and we need to talk about that.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lee was leaning forward slightly, with his head down. It appeared he had something to say, but he was silent. Phil continued, his pace unrushed, no edginess in his voice, no recrimination in his tone.</p>
<p class="tx">“Lee, this situation is somewhat awkward, I know. After all, you and Nate are really good friends, and have been for a long time. In fact, Nate was telling me about some of the things you guys have done together over the years, and it was obvious how much he values your friendship. He thinks the world of you, Lee, and he has the utmost respect for your background, and the knowledge you have, and the way you’re using that knowledge for the greater good. That’s why he approached you about working with us in the first place, Lee—he knows you can do so much good for so many people, given the opportunity.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lee looked up at Phil, and looked back down. Again, he said nothing. Phil was on a roll.</p>
<p class="tx">“We were talking earlier, and the only concern he expressed was that you might not realize how things work in our world, and what we encounter all the time. He was worried that you might think that something could disqualify you, when in reality there’s not a whole lot we haven’t seen and been able to work through. You know, Nate was saying you’re kind of a perfectionist, and the fact is, we live in an imperfect world, Lee.”</p>
<p class="tx">In the bathroom, Nate was struggling to hear Phil’s lowered voice. What he was hearing was making him crazy. <span class="epub-i">He’s not even twenty minutes into it, and he’s interrogating my guy? What the hell is he doing?</span> Phil was just getting started.</p>
<p class="tx">“We talk with guys all the time who think they have to be perfect. That’s not the way it works, Lee. It just isn’t. Listen, this is a little bit awkward for me, too, you know? Nate’s my friend, too, and of course I don’t want to have to deliver any bad news to him. But that’s just it, Lee—it doesn’t have to be bad news. There’s no reason in the world why it has to be bad news. Because whatever it is that’s bothering you, you have to understand it can be fixed. It’s a fixable problem. It’s nothing we haven’t dealt with before, nothing that would surprise us. I’ve been doing this for a long time, Lee, and I can tell you, there’s not a single problem that’s ever come up in this kind of a situation that we haven’t been able to work through and fix. Because we know that people do things for all kinds of reasons, and sometimes those reasons just involve things that lie outside their control. Sometimes they just don’t realize how serious something might be, or that it’s a problem at all. They simply haven’t thought their way through the whole thing.”</p>
<p class="tx">By this time, Phil was starting to get repetitive. Of course, that was the whole idea. Remember the infomercial analogy? The more frequently a person hears something, the more likely he is to accept it, or to at least be open to the possibility of accepting it. Phil kept going for the better part of an hour. Lee sat the entire time with his head down, not saying a word. Finally, Phil decided it was time to test the water. He needed to know where Lee’s head was at. To do that, he had to give Lee a chance to talk. Phil paused, and with the compassionate voice of a caring mentor, he took that next step.</p>
<p class="tx">“Lee, when I asked you about working for another intelligence service, who were you thinking about?”</p>
<p class="tx">After a momentary pause, Lee looked up, seemingly mustering the courage to formulate the words. “The Foelandians,” he said.</p>
<p class="tx">There it was. Okay. Phil nodded with a look of finally understanding what Lee was going through.</p>
<p class="tx">“Thank you, Lee. That makes perfect sense. Let’s face it, your life’s work has been built around associating with and understanding the Foelandian people. And you know what? I don’t blame you a bit. I’ve always been fascinated by Foeland, too, and I’ve often thought about how incredible it would be to travel through the country, and to meet the people and see everything. But I don’t have that option, because it’s just too hard, Lee. Because of the way things are in the world, there are just too many hoops to jump through.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lee looked up. Phil seemed to be striking a chord.</p>
<p class="tx">“So regardless of all the political stuff, Lee, I can fully understand why you would be attracted to the Foelandian people. I just need to have an understanding of why you were thinking about the Foelandians when I asked you the question about working for another intelligence service, Lee. So let’s talk about it. Let’s at least do that.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lee nodded. “Okay,” he said.</p>
<p class="tx">After taking a moment to collect his thoughts, he began his story by taking Phil back to the World Cup, when he met Otto. He said Otto had introduced him to a Foelandian friend of his who lived in the city where the university he was attending was located. Lee said he and this friend of Otto’s, whom we’ll call “Horace,” also struck up a friendship, and that they often talked about Lee’s studies and his acquaintances in the university. He said he had applied for a position as a research assistant to one of the senior faculty members, and when he mentioned to Horace that he had been accepted, the Foelandian seemed to be especially interested in the connection. Lee said this particular faculty member served as an advisor to U.S. policymakers, and that fact appeared to be what had piqued Horace’s interest. Horace would often ask about the advisory work the faculty member was performing for the government, Lee said, acknowledging that he would occasionally provide Horace with copies of documents pertaining to the faculty member’s government-related activities.</p>
<p class="tx">By that point, Phil fully recognized that the issue he was dealing with was perilously close to the worst-case edge of the continuum. He went back into his monologue. This time, the transition was from DOC to DOG.</p>
<p class="tx">“Lee, thank you for sharing that with me, it’s tremendously helpful. It’s become very clear that what we’re dealing with here is your work with Horace in an intelligence-gathering capacity, and having that out in the open makes this so much easier to fix. Lee, please understand that in our world, this is the sort of thing we see all the time. I’ve worked with people from all walks of life—mothers, fathers, students, government officials, corporate executives—who have found themselves in exactly the same situation we’re looking at right now. The reason is that genuinely good people sometimes get in over their heads, and before they know it, they’re thinking, ‘Jeez, how did I get into this?’ They got into it because their hearts were in the right place. I mean, let’s face it: Your Foelandian friends have helped and supported you over the years, and it’s only natural to want to repay them somehow. If someone does you a favor, it’s just natural to want to do him a favor in return. That’s just natural, Lee. I understand that, Nate understands that, everybody understands that. Maybe your Foelandian friends took advantage of you—I don’t know, that’s not my call, and I’m not going to sit here in judgment of anybody. What I do know is that this is a fixable problem. But in order to fix it, we need to get everything out on the table so we know what we’re dealing with. That’s the only way. So, Lee, who do you think these people were that you were gathering this information for?”</p>
<p class="tx">Lee shrugged.</p>
<p class="tx">“Come on, Lee,” Phil said, his voice as calm and measured as it had been all along. “You know who they were, right?”</p>
<p class="tx">Lee nodded.</p>
<p class="tx">“Who were they, Lee?” Phil asked.</p>
<p class="tx">Lee looked at Phil. “Same as you,” he said.</p>
<p class="tx">“No, Lee. No. Who were they?” Phil’s tone was gently encouraging, as if he was eager to help Lee lift an enormous weight off his chest.</p>
<p class="tx">Lee’s head dropped. “FIS,” he said, referring to the Foelandian Intelligence Service.</p>
<p class="tx">In the bathroom, Nate closed his eyes, and shook his head. This longtime friend was an FIS asset. It seemed unthinkable, and yet he had heard it himself, straight from Lee. His mind started to drift off to some of the times he had spent with his friend, but he snapped it back. He needed to hear the rest, but at that point Phil decided to give Lee a breather.</p>
<p class="tx">“Thank you for that,” Phil said. “I know that wasn’t easy. Tell you what. Let’s take a break.”</p>
<p class="tx">Phil went into the bathroom. There was Nate, still shaking his head.</p>
<p class="tx">“I was going to <span class="epub-i">kill</span> you,” Nate said. Phil wasn’t sure whether Nate was most perturbed about the interview having transitioned to an interrogation, Lee’s revelation, or just being stuck in the tiny bathroom for the duration of what seemed like an interminable monologue.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yeah, I’m sorry, Nate,” Phil said, knowing this had to be tough on him.</p>
<p class="tx">“No, you played it exactly right,” Nate conceded. “We have to get to the bottom of this.” He apparently felt better after venting.</p>
<p class="tx">“I will,” Phil assured him. “Just be patient.” Nate nodded. They agreed they would go for as long as it took.</p>
<p class="tx">Phil sat back down with Lee, and continued where he had left off. The rest was painful, but it could have been worse. Lee admitted that when he and Nate were at the university, he had informed his FIS handlers that Nate might be applying to work at the CIA or the FBI. He said they encouraged him to maintain and deepen the friendship.</p>
<p class="tx">Lee said when he graduated and returned to his home country, he was introduced to a new Foelandian contact, and he acknowledged to Phil that he knew the contact was a FIS agent. Phil asked what had persuaded him to work with the FIS, and whether it was for financial gain. Lee responded that he had occasionally received small sums of cash, but that wasn’t what enticed him.</p>
<p class="tx">“Then why are you doing this?” Phil asked.</p>
<p class="tx">Lee seemed almost embarrassed by the simplicity of it all. “I like Foelandians,” he said.</p>
<p class="tx">Back in the bathroom, Nate was listening intently. <span class="epub-i">Ask him, Phil.</span></p>
<p class="tx">It was as if Phil could read Nate’s mind. He asked Lee if he had told his FIS handlers that Nate had recruited him to work for the Agency. Lee said he had not, and confessed that what he was most ashamed of was telling them about Nate when they were back at the university. Lee showed no signs of deceptive behavior in his response. He had simply been torn in two directions: He just liked Foelandians, and he liked his good friend, Nate, too.</p>
<p class="tx">At eight o’clock the next morning, fourteen hours after it had begun, Phil’s work was done. Nate, on the other hand, had more work to do. He was livid that Lee had betrayed him, but the pain of that betrayal was mitigated by the fact that Lee hadn’t reported his recent contacts with Nate, or his recruitment. A couple of weeks later, Nate, along with an FBI agent, took Lee back to the city where the university was located, and they went to all the places where Lee had met with his FIS handlers. Among the information passed to the FBI were the identities of those handlers.</p>
<p class="tx">With the Lee case at the top of our mind, then, our next step is to dive a little more deeply into the delivery and the content of the all-important monologue. We’ll begin that dive in the next chapter.</p>
