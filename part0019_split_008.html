<p class="apct"><span class="epub-b">RESISTANCE AND THE CONCEPT OF “COMMITMENT/CONSISTENCY”</span></p>
<p class="tni">When the Chinese took American prisoners during the Korean War, they knew that they would face strong resistance in their efforts to get the Americans to provide information, or to willingly serve as conduits of propaganda. However, they were able to achieve many of their aims by means of a simple tool of influence that’s extremely powerful in overcoming resistance. It’s what the social psychologist Robert Cialdini refers to in his book <span class="epub-i">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</span> as <span class="epub-i">commitment/consistency</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">Rather than employ torture or other crude methods that were, at best, limited in their effectiveness, the Chinese, Cialdini points out, simply persuaded the Americans to make small concessions, in writing. Over time, the psychological impact of the concessions increased, and the prisoners’ statements grew to be more and more reflective of sentiments that could be considered as pro-Chinese and anti-Western. The Chinese intelligence officers had tapped into a strong psychological driver: the desire people have to act consistently with their public statements and with the image of how they are perceived.</p>
<p class="tx">Recent political scandals, along with historical revisionism on the part of political figures, have left many to wonder why some people will, often illogically, leap to the defense of those whose actions more sensibly warrant challenge, correction, or, heaven forbid, education. The answer is simple: the human desire, often unconscious, to appear to be consistent.</p>
<p class="tx">Many will recall that when former Alaska governor Sarah Palin visited Boston in 2011, she mangled the history of Paul Revere’s ride. In her version of events, Revere wasn’t warning the colonists of the approach of the British, but was warning the British that they’d better not take away the colonists’ arms. In making a statement in support of Second Amendment rights, Governor Palin had dramatically altered a piece of American history that even schoolchildren know well. Despite the obviousness of the gaffe, she and many of her supporters later went to great lengths to defend what she had said, at one point contending that it was when he was detained by a British patrol that Revere had warned them against taking away the colonists’ arms. She would later revise her explanation and fall back to insisting that there were some British in the area whom Revere was warning when he was making several rides and “ringing those bells.” Throughout it all, many of her supporters stood by her version of events. The reason? Commitment/consistency.</p>
<p class="tx">Governor Palin had committed herself when she made that initial, off-the-cuff remark, and she refused to back down from it. The fear of appearing inconsistent in her statements trumped any concern of being shown to be wrong. Those who defended her had, in large part, backed her as a spokesperson for them and their values, and were committed to the consistency of their support despite the factual errors in her account.</p>
<p class="tx">The Irish writer and poet Oscar Wilde once said, “Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.” This wonderful reflection on our innate desire to conserve intellectual energy might help explain the psychology of commitment/consistency. Once someone commits to something, it’s as if he goes on autopilot, following a course that can be viewed as consistent with that commitment. This has a huge potential impact on the way in which others can influence us, take advantage of us, and even use us for their own ends. Of course, it follows that it also has useful applicability in enabling us to influence others.</p>
<p class="tx">I focus heavily on this theory in negotiation classes as an example of why position-based bargaining is counterproductive. If you allow people to commit, especially repeatedly, to a particular position, they will become entrenched and will proceed to maintain, often unreasonably, a stand that’s consistent with that position. The same is true when interviewing or examining a witness. The greater the extent to which someone is allowed to articulate a position, the more entrenched he becomes, and the more difficult it will be to sway him. Instead, it’s best to identify an <span class="epub-i">interest</span> held by the other person that conforms to your own interests and purpose, allow him to openly acknowledge and commit to that interest, and then encourage him to act consistently in accordance with his interest-based commitment.</p>
<p class="tx">I recall once appearing before a judge with whom I had, to put it mildly, a frosty relationship. I was before him defending a motion, the loss of which would cost my client a considerable sum of money. There were two factors in my favor. First, the judge was running for a higher judicial office, and had made a campaign promise that was set in stone: He would not be an activist judge, one who “legislates from the bench.” Second, to rule against my client, the judge would have to apply a novel, though not inconceivable, interpretation of the law.</p>
<p class="tx">I was fortunate in that the motion was the first matter of the day to be heard, and the courtroom was filled with lawyers, their clients, and the jury panel for that day. After the opposing counsel had finished his argument, I stood up, recited the rule to be interpreted, and made a statement that went something like this: “Your Honor, this is the rule, this is the plain English reading of the rule. To hold against my client, your Honor is being asked to rewrite this rule and to legislate from the bench. I am in your hands.” I noticed the judge glance around the filled courtroom. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I won. My sense was that the judge’s blood pressure was the loser that day.</p>
<p class="tx">No question, it is socially and politically desirable to be seen as consistent. What politician ever wants to hear the term “flip-flopper” applied to her? The charge, in fact, can be a scathing insult. Cialdini cites a quote attributed to the nineteenth-century English chemist and natural philosopher Michael Faraday. When asked whether a rival chemist, whom he despised, was “always wrong,” Faraday replied, “He’s not that consistent.” Indeed, being seen as inconsistent is sometimes more of an affront than being seen as wrong.</p>
<p class="tx">Keeping the commitment/consistency principle at the top of your mind can be very helpful in avoiding the trap of falling prey to those who would be inclined to use it against you. Have you ever noticed that highly effective salespeople have <span class="epub-i">you</span> fill out the contract or purchase order, especially when there is a cooling-off period that would allow you to cancel the contract? This approach is routinely taught in sales seminars, especially in states where cooling-off statutes have been enacted.</p>
<p class="tx">Similarly, in the legal realm, lawyers routinely have their clients fill out retainer contracts, writing in the prices and terms, initialing here, signing there. Is all of that really necessary? Yes, if you want them to be committed to the contract.</p>
<p class="tx">At the beginning of depositions, lawyers will ask deponents to agree that they will work with the lawyer to provide full and truthful responses, and to commit that if they are unclear about anything, they will stop the attorney and ask for clarification. The purpose is twofold.</p>
<p class="tx">First, asking for those commitments makes it very difficult for the deponent to come back later, when the deposition is over, and say that he gave a particular answer only because he didn’t understand the question. If he does decide to give that a shot, it’s very difficult for him to come up with a good response to the lawyer’s next question: “But, Mr. Smith, don’t you remember at the beginning of the deposition that you agreed that if you did not understand my question, you would ask me, then and there, for clarification?”</p>
<p class="tx">Second, the deponent has committed to be truthful and cooperative. If, during the course of the deposition, he becomes in any way obstructive or defensive, we remind him of his commitment, and simply ask him to act in a manner that is consistent with it.</p>
<p class="tx">I’ve also found this to be a tremendously useful tool in negotiation and mediation. At the outset, I ask the other side to commit to work with me honestly and constructively. In some cases I have even written up short agreements that we all sign, stipulating that we all agree to be fair and truthful. The results that I’ve seen this small gesture yield are amazing.</p>
<p class="tx">In the classroom, too, I have utilized this commitment strategy to encourage students to complete all work assigned for a course. One course I taught required students to watch a series of video lectures online. I had the students sign an agreement that they would watch all of the lectures, and that if they didn’t do so, they would fail the course, regardless of how well they performed on the tests. After the final exam, one student, who had aced the exam, came up to me and said, “Look, I did really well on the tests. Is it okay if I don’t watch the last lecture?” I took out his “contract” and showed it to him. He nodded, and left to watch the lecture.</p>
<p class="tx">It’s essential, then, to stay on the offensive side of the commitment/consistency line. In depositions, in negotiation, in mediation, even when buying a house or a car, your aim should be for the person on the other side of the table to commit that he will act fairly and abide by the rules. If the circumstances allow for it, get him to agree to having you both sign a written statement to that effect. Then, if he strays from that path, you can politely remind him of the commitment you both made at the outset.</p>
