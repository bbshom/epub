<p class="apct"><span class="epub-b">SHIFTING GEARS: FROM ASSESSMENT TO PERSUASION</span></p>
<p class="tni">As Phil sat in the hotel room with Omar, he observed Omar’s deception and knew that before him was a man who had spied on the United States and evaded detection for two decades. Phil had no doubt that this man posed a serious threat to U.S. security. But there was a cavernous gap between what Phil knew, and what could be proved. How Phil transitioned from listening and observing, to persuading Omar to tell the truth, would have a direct impact on the success of the encounter, and, ultimately, on the security interests of the United States. The stakes were extraordinarily high.</p>
<p class="tx">Whether you’re trying to get someone to provide you with information he doesn’t want to reveal, pay you money he’d rather keep for himself, or agree to the favorable terms you’re seeking on a lease agreement, the <span class="epub-i">transition</span> is the point at which you move from the role of assessing what the other person has been saying to you, into the role of advocate, convincing the person to act honestly and in accordance with your aims.</p>
<p class="txs">In a negotiation situation, there are five stages in an effective, persuasive, and impactful encounter:</p>
<p class="apnl">1) Preparation</p>
<p class="apnl">2) Assessment</p>
<p class="apnl">3) Persuasion</p>
<p class="apnl">4) Exchange of proposals and options</p>
<p class="apnl">5) Closing</p>
<p class="stx">Before coming to your meeting, it’s essential to ensure that you’re fully prepared (see Appendix II). Throughout the first portion of the meeting, you will have asked probing questions, listened, observed, and fully assessed what the other party has conveyed to you. Through your research prior to the meeting, and the information you gather during your assessment, you will have learned what motivates the other party, and what his interests are.</p>
<p class="tx">Now you’re ready to employ your advocacy skills to persuade the other party to provide what you’re seeking. In an elicitation situation, what you’re seeking is the full truth. In a negotiation setting, it’s the resolution you’re aiming for. Many people believe that it takes years to become a skilled advocate. That’s not the case at all. We all have the ability to formulate, and deliver, a persuasive argument. If we’ve done our preparation, and truly heard what the other side values, we can leverage that information to effectively persuade.</p>
<p class="tx">In the negotiation context, your persuasive statement—the negotiation equivalent of a monologue—should be detailed, balanced, concise, and sincere. Let’s examine each of those elements:</p>
<p class="aph1"><span class="epub-b">Detailed</span></p>
<p class="tni">Your statement should clearly outline each item that you want the other side to consider. Don’t hesitate to bring photos, documents, or other exhibits to support your position. When negotiating for the purchase of a vehicle or other large item, written information about prices for these items elsewhere is good to have with you.</p>
<p class="aph1"><span class="epub-b">Balanced</span></p>
<p class="tni">It’s a fatal approach to be strictly one-sided, failing to recognize the validity of portions of the argument made by the other side. If you have information or evidence that contradicts what the other party has put forth, by all means, present it. But recognize the importance to them of what they have said—never dismiss anything out of hand. If the other side makes a point that you can’t contradict, or a demand that costs you little or nothing, then concede to it.</p>
<p class="aph1"><span class="epub-b">Concise</span></p>
<p class="tni">Concentrate on the matter at hand—don’t recite facts that both sides are familiar with or that are uncontested. Don’t bring extraneous matters like personal issues or criticisms into the discussion. You can easily lose the attention of the other party if you are insulting or demeaning, or if you take too long to present your side.</p>
<p class="aph1"><span class="epub-b">Sincere</span></p>
<p class="tni">While a negotiation is not a plea to a jury, or to a group of voters, it is important that the other side see, and hear, your sincerity. If you become emotional in presenting your case, as long as it’s genuine and not contrived, and it’s within the bounds of social decorum (uncontrolled sobbing isn’t likely to further your aims), don’t be concerned. It can serve to authenticate your sincerity.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, bear in mind that in order to effectively persuade the other party, it’s essential to remain fully engaged throughout the entire encounter. Both parties need to feel confident that they have the attention of the other, and that everything they’re saying is being heard. To that end, avoid all distractions and interruptions. Turn off your phone, and keep your laptop out of reach. And insist that the other party do the same.</p>
