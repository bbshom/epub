<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_1">EMOTION</h2>

<p class="tni">Since Jan has to change her strategy, she may well give emotion a shot. This might take the form of crying, hitting you with an outburst of anger, or showing a flare-up of fear or panic. You certainly don’t want to ignore the emotion, but you can’t allow it to steer you away from your approach, either. If Jan starts crying, you want to acknowledge it, and then overcome it by making it clear, gently but firmly, that it’s not going to work:</p>
<p class="tx">“Jan, I know you’re upset. Please understand that’s not my intent—the last thing I want to do is to make this any harder for you than it has to be. And you also need to understand that it’s not going to fix anything—getting upset isn’t going to do either one of us any good.”</p>
<p class="tx">And then you go right back to your monologue.</p>
<p class="tx">Outbursts of anger or panic can be a little more difficult to handle, but they’re manageable, as long as you keep your cool. Susan once conducted a routine security reinvestigation of an Agency employee we’ll call “Stella,” a woman she had to interview four times because of the deceptive behaviors she exhibited in response to questions about her protection of classified information. Stella, who had referred to Susan as the “bleached blond goddess of torture” after the first three encounters, was having a tough time. These interviews can be difficult under any circumstances due to their inherently invasive nature, but for a person who’s trying to withhold information, they’re not only difficult, but incredibly draining. By the fourth interview, it was clear to Susan that Stella had engaged in some particularly egregious mishandling of highly classified documents, so she transitioned into elicitation mode. As Susan progressed through her monologue with calm assurances that she had seen this sort of thing many times before with other employees, her tone was caring and sympathetic. It didn’t have the desired effect. Stella started screaming at Susan that she had had enough, and that if Susan didn’t back off, she was going up to the seventh floor—the floor where the director’s suite and other high-level offices are located—and throw herself off the balcony.</p>
<p class="tx">Susan was unfazed. “Stella, I know how difficult this must be,” she said gently. “But the only way to fix this is to remain calm and levelheaded so that you can help us understand what has happened, and why. That way, it can be resolved, and we can get past it.” And she went right back into her monologue.</p>
<p class="tx">Just as in the case of neutralizing convincing statements, the message that’s conveyed is simple: <span class="epub-i">It didn’t work. You’re not going to intimidate me, you’re not going to sway me, you’re not going to influence me. You’re going to have to come up with a different plan, and I’m here to help you do that.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Although emotion can be difficult to handle, its display isn’t necessarily a bad thing. We’ve found that quite often the confession comes very soon after emotion is exhibited. Emotion, particularly anger and aggression, is often a last resort. Once you work your way through that, you’re just about there. The person realizes there’s no use in trying to keep going.</p>
