<p class="btnis">Here’s a list of some sample transition statements that illustrate the gradation from gentle to strong along the scale from direct observation of concern to direct observation of guilt:</p>
<p class="bbl">•    You seem to be thinking about something.</p>
<p class="bbl">•    Something is clearly on your mind.</p>
<p class="bbl">•    Something seems to be bothering you when we talk about …</p>
<p class="bbl">•    You seem uncertain when you say …</p>
<p class="bbl">•    When I ask you about _____, I can see some concern on your face.</p>
<p class="bbl">•    I’m a little uncomfortable with your answer.</p>
<p class="bbl">•    I have some concerns about what you’re telling me.</p>
<p class="bbl">•    Based on our conversation, it appears you have more to tell us.</p>
<p class="bbl">•    I think you need to rethink your answer.</p>
<p class="bbl">•    I have a problem with some of the things you’ve told me.</p>
<p class="bbl">•    We’ve completed our investigation and, frankly, we can’t eliminate you from our list of suspects.</p>
<p class="bbl">•    Our investigation indicates that you are involved in some way.</p>
<p class="bbl">•    Our investigation clearly shows that you …</p>
<p class="bbl">•    I’m absolutely certain that I know the <span class="epub-i">who</span> and the <span class="epub-i">what</span>. Now all I need to understand is the <span class="epub-i">why</span>.</p>

<p class="tx">That’s not to say that the DOG, “Our investigation clearly shows that you did it,” is never appropriate—it can be the most appropriate transition statement to use. The point is to ensure that your approach in determining the strength of your transition statement is governed by careful consideration of a range of factors, including your level of confidence, the sensitivity of the issue under investigation, the political dynamics, and the person’s level of sophistication. The transition statement is highly nuanced, so it’s best to have a number of arrows in your transition statement quiver that you can pull out, depending on the circumstances of the interrogation situation.</p>
