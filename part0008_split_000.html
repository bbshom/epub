<p class="tni">Consider the perfect burglary. It occurs when a burglar enters the target building without being detected, conducts the theft, and leaves—with no one the wiser.</p>
<p class="tx">If we think of Omar’s case as a burglary, he was well on his way to committing the perfect crime. He escaped detection when he entered. He conducted his pilferage for years without being discovered. But when he sat down with Phil in that hotel suite, he hadn’t succeeded in his mission, because he had yet to make an undetected getaway.</p>
<p class="tx">The two were engaged in a complex mental showdown. Omar was evaluating Phil, just as Phil was evaluating Omar. Phil had been in that position plenty of times before, and he was well aware of the weapons his opponent possessed to use against him. Looming largest was Omar’s willingness and determination to deceive. There was, in addition, Omar’s ability at some level to disguise that deception. And then there was, no doubt, some degree of confidence that he would be able to accomplish his aim.</p>
<p class="tx">Phil’s plan of attack began with an assault on Omar’s confidence. That entailed sending him a very clear message: <span class="epub-i">Your mission has failed. Everything you have done up to this point to accomplish your mission—the hidden path to success that you thought you were on—has ended in failure, because you didn’t get out. You were caught on the inside, committing the act. You have no choice now but to change your strategy.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Phil and Omar were each in a position to help the other. Phil needed information and cooperation from Omar; Omar needed a new game plan, because his old one failed. Phil’s task was to offer him a replacement strategy in a way that didn’t cause Omar to throw up his defenses, and that didn’t alert him to the fact that at that moment, Phil was switching from interview mode to interrogation mode. What marked the switch—and what initiated the message—is what we call the <span class="epub-i">transition statement</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">The transition statement is the first sentence or two of the monologue. It takes the form of a <span class="epub-i">direct observation of concern</span> (DOC), a <span class="epub-i">direct observation of guilt</span> (DOG), or some variant that falls between the two.</p>
<p class="tx">The DOC lies at one end of what you might think of as your own confidence spectrum. Imagine you’re the manager at a pharmacy, and the pharmacist has informed you that several dozen oxycodone tablets are missing. You’re interviewing one of the pharmacy technicians—we’ll call her “Jan”—about the missing tablets, and she appears to be having a problem. Some of the behaviors she exhibits—perhaps some inconsistencies in her story, perhaps instances of evasiveness—lead you to determine that it’s time to go into interrogation mode. At this point you have your suspicions about Jan, but you realize there’s a lot you still don’t know. You decide to convey a DOC, which might go something like this:</p>
<p class="tx">“Jan, I want you to know that your cooperation is very helpful, and I really do appreciate it. The thing is, some of what you’re saying just isn’t adding up, and I need you to help me understand what I’m missing.”</p>
<p class="tx">Now, let’s say that after speaking with the pharmacist and reviewing the dispensing records and time sheets, it’s clear that despite her denials, the only person who could have taken the oxycodone is Jan. Your confidence level is over on the high end of the spectrum, so your transition statement becomes a DOG:</p>
<p class="tx">“Jan, I have to tell you, based on our conversation, based on the inquiry we’ve conducted, based on all the facts we’ve collected, there’s no doubt that you’re the person who took the oxycodone.”</p>
<p class="tx">As we mentioned, your transition statement might be a variant that falls somewhere in between the two, depending on your level of confidence. Let’s say all indications are that Jan is the one who took the oxycodone, but you have just enough doubt to be compelled to leave the door open to the possibility that she didn’t do it. In that case, your transition statement might be something along these lines:</p>
<p class="tx">“Jan, at this point we know the <span class="epub-i">what.</span> We also know the <span class="epub-i">who</span>. But what we don’t know is the <span class="epub-i">why</span>. And that’s what you and I need to talk about.”</p>
<p class="tx">Jan got the message—she’s pretty much busted. But you’ve delivered it without being as direct, and with just enough wiggle room to back out if you need to. Bear in mind that in all three cases, even though the language changes, the statements are delivered in precisely the same manner—your tone is low-key, your voice is soft, and your pace is unrushed. By the very nature of the circumstances, you’re in an adversarial position. But you’re pulling the rug out from under that fact with your delivery.</p>
<p class="tx">Note, as well, that the words you use to convey your message need to be well chosen. In the DOG, you referred to an “inquiry,” not an investigation. You said she “took” the oxycodone, she didn’t “steal” it. Those nuances help to keep Jan in short-term thinking mode. It’s important to use language that doesn’t trigger consequential thoughts—like the prospect of getting fired, or serving jail time.</p>
<p class="tx">The beauty of the transition statement is that it immediately conveys to the individual that nothing she has done up to that point to try to beat you has worked, yet that painful message is delivered below the radar, where it doesn’t trigger her defenses and create an adversarial relationship. Now she’s thinking, since what she’s been doing has been unsuccessful, where does she go from here? How should she handle it? Should she give you a little bit? Should she try to blame it on someone else? She’s trying to rethink her game plan, and guess what. You’re right there to give her some other things to think about. Since everything she was thinking about before just blew up in her face, what you give her to think about might just sound pretty good—especially when it’s delivered in such a low-key, nonconfrontational manner.</p>
<p class="tx">That’s why a shift into interrogation mode that involves launching into a fist-pounding, vein-popping rant as a means of getting a person to tell you something he wants to conceal is so fundamentally counterproductive. You’ve given him something else to think about, all right. You’ve motivated him to draw the battle lines, identify you as the enemy, and entrench himself in resistance. Your job has just become exponentially more difficult.</p>
<p class="tx">Beyond that, a person who’s being deceptive is incentivized to do everything in his power to try to get the spotlight off of himself, and onto someone else. Since you’re a natural, and very convenient, target of the attempted shift, you need to recognize that if you start getting aggressive and verbally abusive, the deceptive person is likely to try to twist that to his advantage. Suddenly, he’s interviewing you about why you’re mistreating him, and you’re getting nowhere. If you remain unruffled and soft-spoken, you take that option off the table, and you remain in control.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Now, let’s go back and look at Phil’s encounter with Omar. When Phil asked that fateful question about whether Omar had ever worked for another intelligence service, the reality was that it was an extremely broad question. So when Omar responded with what Phil identified as deceptive behavior, now it was Phil who was being presented with a question to be answered: What part of that broad question was troubling Omar?</p>
<p class="tx">When confronted with the task of narrowing down the possibilities, there’s a tendency to start to think about what the problem might be. Often, the natural inclination is to ask more questions to try to pinpoint where the issue lies on the best-case/worst-case continuum. But there’s an inherent danger in that, as Phil had learned the hard way when he interviewed Mary: Trying to do any pinpointing before the shift into interrogation mode can backfire, big-time. During the interview, we determine from the person’s behavior what it is he wants to hide, and we begin to narrow down the likely parameters we’re dealing with along the continuum. It’s only in the course of the interrogation that we’re able to determine where, within those parameters, the situation falls.</p>
<p class="tx">When he decided the pivotal moment had come to shift into interrogation mode, Phil delivered a transition statement in the form of a DOC that kept the parameters wide open: “Omar, there’s clearly something here that you’re not telling me, that we need to talk about.” At that moment, Phil had no idea whether the issue he was dealing with was something on the order of Omar’s son hanging out with some unsavory characters who may have had a connection to another intelligence service, or Omar working as an operative against U.S. interests at the behest of the MIS. But he did know that his DOC covered both possibilities. No doubt, because of what he understood to be Omar’s unblemished record, Phil’s head was at the best-case end of the continuum. But the methodology saved him by ensuring that his interrogation covered the full range of possibilities across the spectrum.</p>
<p class="tx">The methodology also has a valuable confirmatory element to it. When Phil said there was “something” Omar wasn’t telling him, that unspecified “something” likely caused Omar to selectively orient himself to what the real problem was. So when it was time for Omar to talk, there was a high probability that Phil would be able to identify the issue, or to at least collect enough clues to enable him to confirm its location on the spectrum.</p>
<p class="tx">One more thing: It’s essential to remember that Omar’s reaction might not have equaled the face value of the question. That is, if Omar had been clean rather than dirty, for example, any deceptive behavior he exhibited in response to Phil’s question about working for another intelligence service would have been something that was relatively inconsequential, like that he had failed to mention being approached by someone he suspected of working for the bad guys. By interrogating to the full length of the spectrum, Phil would likely be successful in getting Omar to admit that failure. If he discovered that was the extent of the problem, Phil would probably say something like this:</p>
<p class="tx">“Omar, thanks. I’m glad you told me. We’re not really concerned about that, so I’m glad we were able to resolve it.”</p>
<p class="tx">In clean Omar’s mind, even though he messed up, he was treated fairly and respectfully, and his loyalty and dedication to U.S. interests are bolstered. The relationship with this key asset remains solid. No damage was done. We’ll elaborate on the value of that in Chapter 10.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">The transition statement is an exhilarating point in the interrogation, with a rush second only to the moment when you actually get the truth. Formulating the transition statement is exciting, because it’s the first time you communicate to the person that you know he did the bad thing, whether you convey that implicitly or explicitly. It’s the strength of the person’s reaction to your statement that’s so telling, because it often signals the level of resistance you’ll likely encounter the rest of the way. From a behavior analysis standpoint, the reaction to the transition statement can reinforce your confidence in whether the person is being deceptive. For example, if, in response to the transition statement, “Our investigation indicates that you’re involved in some way,” the person sits in silence, or responds with something like, “I can’t think of anything that would bother me about an investigation,” you know you’re on the right course. By failing to state with conviction that there’s nothing about an investigation that would bother him, he’s sending you the unintended message that there’s something there, but you haven’t given him a reason to share it with you. What he doesn’t realize is you’re about to give it to him with your monologue.</p>
<p class="tx">At first blush, the DOC and the DOG may appear to be rather mechanical and easy to master. That’s not the case at all. While the transition statement is somewhat formulaic in the sense that it’s a prepared statement that appears at the beginning of the monologue, there is actually a rather complex set of strategic psychological considerations that arise in selecting the phraseology. How well crafted your transition statement is sets the tone of the interrogation to follow and, more often than not, determines whether you’ll be successful.</p>
<p class="tx">The accusatory strength of the DOC and DOG depends upon a number of factors. Let’s say, for example, that your transition statement is, “Our investigation clearly shows that you’re the one who took the money.” That statement lies on the extreme end of the DOG side of the scale, and it can backfire on you because it sets the person up to make a denial. That’s something you want to listen for during the interview, but you want to avoid in an interrogation situation. You already have one hurdle to overcome: getting the person to tell the truth. If you allow him to voice a denial, you have a second, equally formidable hurdle: getting the person to admit that he’s a liar. That scenario can easily degenerate into endless head-butting and frustration, and getting the truth becomes far more difficult.</p>
