<p class="ata">Phil is a nationally recognized authority on deception detection, critical interviewing, and elicitation. His twenty-five-year career with the Central Intelligence Agency was recognized with the award of the Career Intelligence Medal, highlighted by his service as a senior member of the Office of Security. In that capacity, he conducted thousands of interviews and interrogations for the CIA and other federal agencies, both as an investigator and as a polygraph examiner. He is credited with developing detection of deception and elicitation methodologies currently employed throughout the U.S. intelligence and federal law enforcement communities. The scope of Phil’s work has covered criminal activity, personnel security, and key national security matters, including counterintelligence and counterterrorism. The fact that many of his interviews were conducted in foreign countries, coupled with six years of residence overseas, has given him unique insight and extensive experience in working with foreign cultures.</p>
<p class="ata-tx">The story of Phil’s success in creating a commercial application and market for the detection of deception methodology was featured in the 2010 book, <span class="epub-i">Broker, Trader, Lawyer, Spy</span> by Eamon Javers. Phil holds a BA in political science from East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina, and he is a 2013 recipient of the ECU Alumni Association’s Outstanding Alumni Award.
