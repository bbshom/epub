<p class="tni">On the evening of June 12, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ron Goldman, were savagely murdered at Nicole’s home in Brentwood, California. On October 3, 1995, Nicole’s ex-husband, Orenthal James Simpson—the football hero turned movie star who had been charged with the murders—was acquitted in what many see as one of the most egregious miscarriages of justice in U.S. history.</p>
<p class="tx">In late 2006, a publisher announced the pending release of a book by Simpson, titled <span class="epub-i">If I Did It</span>, a hypothetical account of a scenario in which Simpson committed the murders. Public outrage in response to the announcement compelled the publisher to cancel the release. Ultimately, a Florida bankruptcy court awarded the book rights to the Goldman family, which in January 2008 published <span class="epub-i">If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer.</span> The book includes Simpson’s original manuscript, and provides an invaluable psychological insight into the mind of the hypothetical killer.</p>
<p class="tx">The assignment to question Simpson when he was brought in by the Los Angeles Police Department the day after the murders fell to LAPD detectives Philip Vannatter and Thomas Lange. The encounter commenced at 1:35 in the afternoon, and was terminated just thirty-two minutes later. It took the form of an interview—Vannatter and Lange never interrogated Simpson.</p>
<p class="tx">Our review of the transcript of that interview, the full text of which can be found in Appendix III, has prompted us to consider a hypothetical situation of our own: What would have happened if we had questioned Simpson that day?</p>
<p class="tx">Before we proceed any further, it’s essential to make clear the fact that our aim is not to disparage Vannatter, Lange, or the LAPD in any way. We have the utmost respect for the men and women of the LAPD—in fact, we have had opportunities to conduct training for the department in the past, and we have highly valued those engagements. Beyond that, we are very much aware that there’s nothing particularly valiant or laudable about the role of Monday morning quarterback, especially when it’s performed with the benefit of nearly two decades of hindsight. It’s just a matter of the Simpson case having gained such widespread notoriety, and the fact that so many people are familiar with it to one degree or another even after all these years, that lends the case so compellingly to examination here. Our purpose, then, is not to claim that our hypothetical encounter with Simpson would necessarily have been fruitful, since any such claim is obviously impossible to substantiate. It is imperative that readers be very clear that the responses we have attributed to Simpson in this exercise are purely hypothetical. They reflect our speculation, based on years of experience in other elicitation scenarios, of what Simpson might have said had he been questioned using the methods described in this book. The exercise is intended to illustrate, as coherently as possible, how the interview and elicitation process is meant to be executed from beginning to end.</p>
<p class="txs">With that understood, let’s go back to that June day in 1994, and imagine that we’re the ones who got the call to question Simpson. Our approach would have recognized that in a law enforcement situation, such an encounter begins with an objective interview. Whether or not the interview transitions to an interrogation would depend on the case facts, the evidence that had been collected to that point, and the information gleaned from the interview. For the purpose of this exercise, we’ll put Michael in the questioner’s seat. What follows is the approach we would have taken, and what we see as the way it might have unfolded, based on the experience we’ve had in such cases.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> O.J., please come in and have a seat. My name is Michael Floyd, and I will be asking you some questions this afternoon about the deaths of your ex-wife, Nicole, and a young man who we have now identified as Ronald Goldman. Do you mind if I call you “O.J.”?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No, that’s what most people have called me my entire life. I’m fine with that.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> O.J., before we get into it, I need to take care of some preliminary housekeeping tasks, if you don’t mind. First, may I see some identification, please?</p>
<p class="dias"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> [Produces his California driver’s license]</p>
<p class="dias">[Michael records the information and notices that Simpson is favoring a bandaged middle finger on his left hand.]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> The final thing I need to do before we get started is to read you your constitutional rights per our conversation with your attorney, Howard Weitzman. Are you okay with that?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yes. I’ve got nothing to hide.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I’m glad to hear you say that. O.J., you have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney and to have an attorney present during the questioning. If you so desire and cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you without charge before questioning. Do you understand your rights?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Do you have any questions about that?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Do you wish to give up your right to remain silent and talk with me today?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Uh, yes.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Do you give up your right to have an attorney present while we talk?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> First of all, O.J., thank you very much for coming in. We appreciate your willingness to do that. We know you’re very concerned about your children, and that you’re eager to get back to them to make sure they’re okay. So while there is a lot to cover, we’re going to stick to the most important issues. O.J., I think the most important thing we need to ask you about is, what happened at Nicole’s last night?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> [Behavioral pause] What happened at Nicole’s last night? You’re asking me what happened at Nicole’s last night? How would I know what happened? I was in Chicago. I wasn’t anywhere near there last night.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I understand. Let me explain to you that, obviously, this is a very important case because of who you are. I know you would want us to have every available officer working on this case, and I can assure you we do—every resource we can muster is being tapped to resolve it. As a matter of fact, as we speak, we have officers scouring Nicole’s neighborhood and your neighborhood, trying to figure this thing out, and we’ve been developing some interesting information. O.J., is there any reason that any of the neighbors will tell us they saw you in Nicole’s neighborhood last night?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> [Behavioral pause] Well, um … um … I do occasionally pass through the neighborhood, and sometimes I stop to check on the kids. It’s only ten minutes from my house, and now that I think about it, I did drive through last night, but I didn’t see any lights on, so I didn’t stop.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Thanks for that. That’s helpful to know. I have to ask you, O.J., was it you who caused the deaths of Nicole and that young man last night?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Are you kidding me? I loved Nicole with all of my heart. She’s the mother of my kids. I didn’t even know the other guy. This is crazy, man, really crazy. Do you think I killed them?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> That’s why we’re having this conversation right now, so you can help us sort this thing out. My only objective is to find out what happened, so everyone involved can begin to put their lives back together. Before I get into some specific questions, I’d like you to walk me through your activities last night, starting at nine <span class="epub-sc">P.M</span>. and ending at eleven <span class="epub-sc">P.M.</span> Please be as absolutely detailed as you can be, okay?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Okay. Let’s see, I went to Sydney’s dance recital at Paul Revere High School. It ended about six-thirty, quarter to seven, something like that, you know, in the ballpark, right in that area. Nicole was there with her family, her mother and father, sister, my kids, you know. I remember Nicole was wearing a short skirt that would have looked inappropriate on a sixteen-year-old. She looked ridiculous. Her mother said something about me joining them for dinner but I said no thanks. I went home for a while and dumped my Bentley and got my Bronco. I went looking for my girlfriend, Paula, for a while but she wasn’t home. I was calling her and she wasn’t around, so I went back to the house. It must have been eight-something, maybe. Kato was there. He hadn’t done a Jacuzzi … we had … we went and got a burger, and I’d come home and kind of leisurely got ready to go. I mean, we’d done a few things. That’s about it, I guess. I think you know the limo driver picked me up right around eleven.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Thanks for that, O.J. But maybe I didn’t make myself clear enough earlier. What I’m most interested in has to do with what you did between the hours of nine <span class="epub-sc">P.M.</span> and eleven <span class="epub-sc">P.M.</span> last night. You said you got back to your house at maybe eight-something. Let’s pick up your activities from there. Why don’t you walk me through in detail what you did until the limo driver picked you up, okay?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Man, everything is a blur right now. It’s hard to remember exactly what I did.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I can understand that, O.J., but it’s extremely important to nail some things down, so I need you to do the very best you can to reconstruct your activities, all right?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Let’s see, I remember that I leisurely packed for my trip. I chipped some golf balls in the yard. I took a nap and then the limo driver rang the house and woke me up because I had overslept.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Earlier you mentioned having driven by Nicole’s house to see if they were home. Tell me about that.</p>
<p class="dias"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Oh yeah, sorry about that. I forgot about doing that. Let me think. Maybe after Kato and I got back from McDonald’s, I jumped in the Bronco and took a real quick ride over there on the off chance I might catch them. It must have been nine at the latest.</p>
<p class="dias">[Michael recognizes the unintended message. Simpson’s phrase, “catch them,” is likely what motivated him to drive to Nicole’s house. The reason may have been to catch Nicole with her lover.]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Describe your trip to Nicole’s house in detail: the route you took to and from, who you were with, who you saw, who you talked to, what you did at Nicole’s—your best guess on when you left your house and when you returned.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Wow. Okay. It was just me. I went south on Rockingham, left on Highwood Street, right on Bristol, left on Sunset, right on Bundy. I went home the same way. I always take that route. It’s only about six minutes. Like I said, the lights at Nicole’s were off, so I figured either the kids were already in bed or they hadn’t gotten home yet. So I just kinda went home and that’s about it, as far as I remember.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> What time did you leave your house on Rockingham?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> About nine-fifteen or so, I think.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Could it have been before nine?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Could it have been after nine-thirty?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No way. I’m really sure about that one.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Why is that?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Because I needed to take a shower and finish packing before my trip.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Who did you see during the trip to and from Nicole’s?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Not a soul. Trust me.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Who did you talk to during the trip to and from Nicole’s?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Not a soul. Trust me.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> What did you do while you were at Nicole’s?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Nothing. Like I said, I just drove by.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> At any time did your car ever come to a stop at Nicole’s?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I probably slowed down a little, but I’d have to say I didn’t stop, man, and that’s the honest to God truth.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> At any time did you enter her alley?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> That’s where I park when I go over there.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Last night between nine and eleven, did you park your Bronco at Nicole’s, even for just a short time?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Not that I remember, no.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> O.J., I want you to give this next question some serious thought. Is there any reason that someone would have told us that they saw your white Bronco parked at Nicole’s last night?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Who said they saw me?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I’m not saying at this point anyone saw you, but if someone tells us they did, it’s important you clear it up now, because that could explain a lot of things. Just because someone saw you doesn’t mean you hurt anybody. It’s possible you had a good reason for being there that is completely unrelated to what happened. If that’s the case, we need to clear it up now.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Well, at this point in time I’m going to stick with what I said unless you know something different that can refresh my memory.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> What else should I know about your trip to Nicole’s last night?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> That’s about it, I think.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Let’s revisit the rest of your activities between nine and eleven <span class="epub-sc">P.M.</span> Besides your trip to Nicole’s, you said you did some leisurely packing, chipped golf balls in your backyard, took a nap, and showered. What else did you do?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> That’s it, as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Did you ever leave your Rockingham estate for any reason after nine-thirty last night, except for when you left in the limo around eleven?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> No.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Is it possible you left your house after nine-thirty for Nicole’s, and you could be mistaken?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I’m going to have to say no. Things were crazy last night. Nicole was up to her old tricks at the recital. Her family was acting weird. I was having some problems with Paula. I had my trip to Chicago to get ready for. You know how it is.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Tell me, O.J., how did you get those injuries on your left hand?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I don’t know. The first time, when I was in Chicago and all, but at the house I was just running around. In Chicago I broke a glass. One of you guys had just called me and I was in the bathroom, and I just went bonkers for a little bit. Last night when I was … I don’t know, getting my junk out of the car. I was in the house throwing hangers and stuff in my suitcase. I was doing my little crazy what I do, I mean, I do it everywhere. Anybody who has ever picked me up says that O.J.’s a whirlwind. He’s running, he’s grabbing things, and that’s what I was doing. Getting junk out of the car.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> To be clear, are you telling me you don’t know exactly how you got those injuries on your hand that caused you to bleed so much?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> I really don’t.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Do you see the scar on my forehead?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="dias"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> In 1953, I was sledding down a snow-covered street in Plattsmouth, Nebraska, and went head-first into the bumper of a car parked at the bottom of the hill. This little scar on my calf—barbed wire fence, David City, Nebraska, Public Golf Course, 1963. This little scar below my right eye—Rick Warner elbowed me during basketball practice, 1967. This little scar on my right ankle—number seventy-seven, Grand Island, Nebraska, defensive lineman stomped on me with his steel-tipped cleats when the ref wasn’t looking, 1968. This little scar on my right thumb—broken beer bottle, 1981, Northern Virginia. I could go on, but I think you get my point. Your hand injuries—and they look pretty nasty—happened less than twenty-four hours ago, and you cannot give me a coherent explanation for how you sustained them.</p>
<p class="dias">[At this point, Michael has very little doubt that Simpson committed the murders. The case facts, the evidence that has been gathered, and the large volume of deceptive behaviors exhibited by Simpson during the interview make it clear that it’s time to transition to interrogation mode. Though his level of certainty of Simpson’s guilt is high, Michael makes sure that his transition statement covers the entire best-case/worst-case continuum.]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> O.J., quite frankly, I have some real concerns here. I think it’s only fair that I bring you up to speed on the investigation to date. Here is what I know with certainty, and I ask you to indulge me without interruption until you hear me out. I think what I have to say will be of great interest to you. When I’m done, I’ll turn the floor over to you, and you can comment. Is that fair? Do I have your commitment on that?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Great, O.J. I have so much to share with you, I almost don’t know where to begin. Let me begin with the blood. There is a bloody trail leading directly from Nicole’s to your house, and the blood was found both outside and inside your house. The white Bronco you admit to driving last night is covered in blood, and we know your Bronco is clearly how the blood was transported from Nicole’s to your house. The interesting thing will be confirming whose blood is where, and that won’t take us long. There are bloody footprints along Nicole’s walkway leading to the alley where you park the Bronco. To the left of the footprints are drops of blood. I’d bet my house that it was your blood dripping from your injured left hand as you returned to your Bronco after the struggle. We found a fresh bloody fingerprint on the knob of the gate leading to the alley where your Bronco is typically parked. Again, I’d bet my house that that fingerprint is yours when you opened the gate with your bloody left hand. There was blood everywhere at Bundy. There is no doubt in my mind that because of the mess, both Nicole’s and Ron’s blood became commingled with yours and will not only be found in your Bronco, but also at your house. One of our detectives found a bloody glove at Nicole’s lying on the ground. Interestingly, it is a left-handed glove that would have left the attacker’s left hand exposed to injury. A detective also found a dark-colored knit cap, most likely pulled from the head of the attacker during the struggle, just like the left glove was most likely pulled from the hand of the attacker during the struggle. Hairs were found in the cap, and we will soon know with scientific certainty who those hairs belong to. Kato heard a loud thump on the outside wall behind his bungalow at Rockingham around ten-forty-five last night, and it scared the shit out of him. He thought it was an earthquake at first. He was too afraid to investigate the small walkway behind his bungalow in the dark. You, interestingly, told him before you left not to call your security company or the police. I think I know why you left him with those instructions now. One of our detectives went behind the bungalow to investigate, and guess what he found: The right-handed mate to the left-handed glove found at Nicole’s. The glove found on your property is also covered in blood. No doubt, it will be Nicole’s and Ron’s blood. We even have a witness, a woman driving a Volkswagen, who says she nearly collided with you last night around ten-forty-five when you ran the red light at the intersection of Bundy and San Vicente on your way back to Rockingham. She said your Bronco rode up onto the center median of San Vicente. Another car, a gray Nissan, also stopped to avoid the collision. The woman said you began honking your horn and shouting at her, “Move your damn car! Move it! Move it!” She lives in the neighborhood and recognized you as the driver. She even took down your license plate number. Detectives found dark clothing in your washing machine and a pair of dark socks on the floor of your bedroom, and those are being blood-typed as we speak. We found an empty Swiss Army knife box next to your tub. My hunch is the forensics lab will come back and say there is a match between the Swiss Army knife and the wounds that were inflicted on Nicole and Ron. Your limo driver got to your house twenty minutes early and rang your buzzer, but of course you didn’t answer, because you weren’t there.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> [Complete silence, staring straight ahead, motionless]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> The driver saw you come back to the house and saw your lights come on in the house around ten-fifty. Look, what happened at Nicole’s last night is not the O.J. I know, or the world knows.</p>
<p class="dias"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> If you think I did it, you don’t know me at all.</p>
<p class="dias">[It so happens that there are several actual connections between Michael’s background and Simpson’s. Michael chooses to introduce them here.]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I’m glad you said that, O.J., because I do know you a little bit. You sure as hell won’t remember this, but in 1977, a good friend of yours, Sam Denoff, arranged for you to crown my sister, Stephanie, Homecoming Queen at her thirty-first birthday party in the Hollywood Hills, up on Queens Road. There were over a hundred people there, and from what she told me, you were a big hit. She later rented Sam’s house at Victoria Beach in Laguna Beach, the house right next door to yours. She spent time with your kids, Arnelle and Jason. She always enjoyed her time with them. My good friend, Don Burpee, played pickup basketball with you at USC every week for two years. He said you were always accessible, and that you always acknowledged him by name around campus. I also have a high school buddy from Nebraska, Denny Hoyle, who was one of your business partners in California Way, the racquetball club up in Pasadena. He always had good things to say about you, too. Heck, you even grew up in the same housing projects on Potrero Hill that my wife did, so I know a little bit about what you had to overcome. Her older sister was Ms. Bronze California, and is just a couple of years younger than you, and my wife’s a doctor now. I even think Danny Glover grew up there. I wouldn’t be surprised if my mother-in-law knew your mother, Eunice. It’s a small, small world, O.J. My point is, I know firsthand the positive impact you’ve had on people, and that at your core you’ve always tried to do the right thing by people. What that tells me is that it wasn’t your character that caused you to do this—it was the situation you found yourself in. You measure a person not by a singular act, but by the totality of his life. Don’t let this singular act define who you are, O.J. Any coward can lie. The real test of a man is whether he’s able to stand up and tell the truth in a difficult situation. You’re thinking emotionally right now, rather than rationally, and I can understand that. I understand that you’re in a very tough spot right now. I think I understand you a little bit, and I’m here to work with you so we can make some sense out of the craziness of last night. I am absolutely positive that I know the <span class="epub-i">who</span> and the <span class="epub-i">what</span> that happened. Now all I need to understand is the most important thing, and that is the <span class="epub-i">why</span> this thing happened. I know there is an explanation that makes sense, and that’s what I want to talk to you about now.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Why would I kill Nicole? She’s the mother of my children. I loved Nicole. And that other guy, I didn’t even know him. Why would I want to kill him?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I understand, O.J. From what I know about you, this whole thing is as surreal as it gets. I’m not going to get into all of that domestic violence bullshit between you and Nicole over the years, because I really don’t care about that. Husbands and wives know what buttons to push, and things get a little nuts with all of us from time to time when emotions run high. I’m sure there were two sides to all of those stories. What I do care about, though, is last night. I’m not buying the theory that this is the classic “If I can’t have you, nobody can” situation. I don’t think you were pining to win her back. You both knew it was over.</p>
<p class="diatx">Let’s face it, Nicole had a real temper on her. I’ve been told if something set her off, she tended to come at you with fists and feet flying, and you had to hold her down sometimes until she could get herself under control. I know you tried like hell to make it work. A couple of years ago, when you guys split, I guess she settled into her new place with the kids. It must have been real tough watching her move forward without you, and knowing she was with other guys in front of your children. I heard she had some questionable friends who were into drugs, and she was becoming more moody and erratic. There was the good Nicole, and the bad Nicole, and it looked like the bad Nicole won. I suspect you were beginning to think she was putting your kids at risk. You had your kids to think about. There’s no way you could let her take you down, and the kids with her. She was an accident waiting to happen, and you owed it to your kids to take some action.</p>
<p class="diatx">I think you went over to her place last night to read her the riot act, and to shake her up a little bit. It sounds like she really needed a wake-up call. This shit was eating you up inside, and it had to stop. You had to get this under control for the kids’ sake, and to get on with your own life.</p>
<p class="diatx">The dark clothes you wore, the knit cap, the gloves, the knife—that was all theater. I know you didn’t plan on killing anybody, for two reasons. First, you would never have planned to do this where your kids would find their dead mother. You’re far too devoted to them to even consider such a scenario. Second, no one leaves this much evidence lying around Brentwood if they had planned the thing out. You are a very smart guy—too smart for the mistakes that were made. All of this leaves me with only one explanation that makes any sense: It was spur-of-the-moment.</p>
<p class="diatx">When you get to Nicole’s, you park near her back gate. You walk up the path and see candles burning inside, and hear soft music. It’s obvious to you that she is expecting company for a romantic encounter. You’re pissed because she is doing it again in front of your kids, but you can deal with that. Just then Ron Goldman appears on the scene, while at the same time Nicole hears you drive up, and she’s at the front door. Nicole doesn’t want to see you, because her lover is there, and she lets you have it. You and Nicole get into it, and now Goldman decides to be a hero and come to Nicole’s aid, when in your mind she was in no physical danger whatsoever. Before you can count to three, you’re being attacked by two people who overreacted and completely misjudged your intentions. To say this is a bad dream is an understatement. At that moment, your survival instincts kick in, and you’re now in the heat of the battle—two against one.</p>
<p class="diatxs">O.J., there are lots of reasons why people do what they do. This isn’t the movies; there was no script last night, there was no plan. Sometimes people just can’t take the pressure anymore. It just builds and builds. For the most part, you were very good to Nicole. But how did she repay you? By embarrassing you in public, humiliating you, taunting you, trying to make you mad, bad-mouthing you to your children. You simply couldn’t let her take down your children with her. Even the strongest person finally just snaps. The next thing you know, it’s just happened—your worst nightmare. Last night, what you walked into on Bundy was the perfect storm. In hindsight, I don’t see how it could have played out any differently. I don’t think there is a person in the world who would not understand how this thing played out.</p>
<p class="dias">[Simpson is showing very little emotion, but his head and shoulders are now slumped. He recognizes that it’s over.]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> O.J., when you drove over to see Nicole last night, did you intend to kill her, or were you just there to protect your kids?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> [Unresponsive]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> O.J., the nightmare is over. It’s time to wake up. Were you there to protect your kids?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> Yeah. Yeah, I was. Oh, God. My life is over. My life is over. Nobody will forgive me. My life is over.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I knew you were raised to acknowledge your mistakes, and to do something about them. I’m glad you had the guts to tell me the truth, O.J. Guts are something you’ve been blessed with, or you never would have achieved what you have in life. Of course, I wish this had never happened, but as a public figure I think how you handle yourself from this point on could have a very positive impact on people who are looking for someone with strength. We live in a very forgiving society. If I understand, and I do, other people will understand. You’ve already got a leg up because of the goodwill you’ve earned over the years.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Simpson:</span> What now?</p>
<p class="dias"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I’d like to hear how this thing went south so fast at Nicole’s last night, O.J. Let’s start with what you did with the knife.</p>
<p class="dias">[For the next two hours, Michael questions Simpson about every detail regarding the murders, until he’s satisfied that he has covered every element of the crime, and that he has obtained all of the truthful information that Simpson is willing to divulge.]</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Is that really the way it would have panned out? Clearly, we have no way of knowing. What we do know is that the outcome of the questioning that day set in motion a sequence of events that prolonged the unspeakable anguish endured by the Brown and Goldman families. And O. J. Simpson, the man later found by a civil court to be culpable for the horrific deaths of the families’ loved ones, walked free. He was soon back on the golf course, enjoying life.</p>
<p class="txs">There’s an interesting footnote to all of this. It so happened that Michael met Detective Lange after Simpson was acquitted, and was able to ask him why he and Detective Vannatter ended their interview after just thirty-two minutes. Lange’s response was that they were concerned Simpson would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights, and he would clam up. It was a nonsensical response. In essence, by ending the interview, Lange and Vannatter invoked the Fifth for him. The situation called not for ending the interview, but for keeping Simpson in short-term thinking mode, so that he wouldn’t focus on the consequences of his actions, and thus feel compelled to invoke the Fifth to protect himself from them. As it was, Simpson sank a PR hole-in-one by facing his accusers without even having his attorney present. He learned more from the LAPD that day than the LAPD learned from him.</p>
