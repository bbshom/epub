<p class="tni">At first glance, it might have appeared that Phil’s monologue in his interrogation of Lee was just a random stream of consciousness, a free-form flow of encouraging comments that spilled out in the hope that some part of it would coax Lee to fess up. That’s not the case at all. While the aim was indeed to persuade Lee to divulge everything he was attempting to conceal, not a word Phil said in the monologue was extraneous to that deliberate intent. Every sentence in his narrative had a distinct, thoughtful objective; each one was consciously woven into a meaningful whole, with no scraps left over to diminish its effectiveness.</p>
<p class="tx">Let’s take a look at the components we use to build a monologue, why we use them, and how they were used in Phil’s interrogation of Lee. Note that there’s no particular order in which the components should necessarily appear in the monologue.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Rationalizing the action</span></p>
<p class="tnis">There is not a single thing a person can do that cannot be rationalized. You can come up with a reason, or an excuse, for absolutely anything. In a monologue, it’s a face-saving exercise that’s extremely effective in the quest to keep the person in short-term thinking mode. Here are a couple of examples of how Phil used rationalization in Lee’s case:</p>
<p class="bp">• “The reason is that genuinely good people sometimes get in over their heads, and before they know it, they’re thinking, ‘Jeez, how did I get into this?’ They got into it because their hearts were in the right place. I mean, let’s face it: Your Foelandian friends have helped and supported you over the years, and it’s only natural to want to repay them somehow. If someone does you a favor, it’s just natural to want to do him a favor in return.”</p>
<p class="bp">• “Because we know that people do things for all kinds of reasons, and sometimes those reasons just involve things that lie outside their control. Sometimes they just don’t realize how serious something might be, or that it’s a problem at all. They simply haven’t thought their way through the whole thing.”</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Projecting the blame</span></p>
<p class="tnis">We all know how easy it is to point the finger at someone else when something bad happens. It can be very tough to take full blame for something, especially when the potential consequences are extremely serious. So you need to make it as easy as possible for the person you’re interrogating to admit his own culpability. We’ve found it’s very effective in a monologue to convey to the person the notion that whatever it is he did, it’s not entirely his fault. So whose fault is it? Society’s, the school’s, the system’s, the government’s. Think big—bigger is always easier to defend, because it’s more nebulous. If you get explicit, you’re putting yourself in harm’s way, because it might sound as if you’re promising him something, or letting him off the hook. In his interrogation of Lee, Phil placed the blame on the amorphous sphere of “politics”:</p>
<p class="bp">• “So regardless of all the political stuff, Lee, I can fully understand why you would be attracted to the Foelandian people.”</p>
<p class="stxs">He also suggested that the Foelandians might shoulder some of the blame, but he did it in a way that didn’t denigrate anyone Lee might feel an affinity toward:</p>
<p class="bp">• “Maybe your Foelandians friends took advantage of you—I don’t know, that’s not my call, and I’m not going to sit here in judgment of anybody.”</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Minimizing the seriousness</span></p>
<p class="tnis">To keep the person in short-term thinking mode, it’s essential that he not dwell on the potential consequences of his actions. A very effective way to prevent that is to downplay the gravity of the situation. You don’t want to dissemble by implying that it’s not a problem. But it is possible to convey some sense that it could be worse, and that the situation isn’t irreparable, with statements like, “It’s not the end of the world,” or “It’s a fixable problem.” You just don’t specify what the “fix” is. Phil conveyed that sense to Lee this way:</p>
<p class="bp">• “[Nate] was worried that you might think that something could disqualify you, when in reality there’s not a whole lot we haven’t seen and been able to work through. You know, Nate was saying you’re kind of a perfectionist, and the fact is, we live in an imperfect world, Lee. We talk with guys all the time who think they have to be perfect. That’s not the way it works.”</p>
<p class="bp">• “Nate’s my friend, too, and of course I don’t want to have to deliver any bad news to him. But that’s just it, Lee—it doesn’t have to be bad news. There’s no reason in the world why it has to be bad news. Because whatever it is that’s bothering you, you have to understand it can be fixed. It’s a fixable problem.”</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Socializing the situation</span></p>
<p class="tnis">We’re all social beings, so your subject needs to feel that he isn’t in isolation, or that he’s been forsaken. He needs to know that other people have been in the same boat he’s in, and we accomplish that by populating the context of the monologue. Here are some examples of how Phil accomplished it with Lee:</p>
<p class="bp">• “Lee, please understand that in our world, this is the sort of thing we see all the time. I’ve worked with people from all walks of life—mothers, fathers, students, government officials, corporate executives—who have found themselves in exactly the same situation we’re looking at right now.”</p>
<p class="bp">• “It’s nothing we haven’t dealt with before, nothing that would surprise us. I’ve been doing this for a long time, Lee, and I can tell you, there’s not a single problem that’s ever come up in this kind of a situation that we haven’t been able to work through and fix.”</p>
<p class="bp">• “I understand that, Nate understands that, everybody understands that.”</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Emphasizing the truth</span></p>
<p class="tnis">Your subject’s frame of mind needs to be focused on telling you the truth, rather than on the action itself. And he needs to be convinced that the <span class="epub-i">only</span> way out of the predicament he’s in is to be truthful with you. Phil made that point very clear with Lee:</p>
<p class="bp">• “What I do know is that this is a fixable problem. But in order to fix it, we need to get everything out on the table so we know what we’re dealing with. That’s the only way.”</p>
<p class="stx">Keep in mind, also, that word choice is a critical element in weaving these components into your monologue. You’ll recall that in the case of Jan, the pharmacy technician who misappropriated the oxycodone tablets, we referred to our <span class="epub-i">inquiry</span> rather than an <span class="epub-i">investigation</span>, and we said she <span class="epub-i">took</span> the tablets, she didn’t <span class="epub-i">steal</span> them. Similarly in the monologue that Phil delivered to Lee, note that in his DOG, Phil referred to Lee’s work with Horace in an <span class="epub-i">intelligence-gathering</span> capacity, rather than in terms of being a <span class="epub-i">spy</span>, or <span class="epub-i">conducting espionage</span>. He made reference to Lee’s Foelandian <span class="epub-i">friends</span> rather than to <span class="epub-i">FIS contacts</span>. Such harsh language needs to be avoided so the subject stays in short-term thinking mode, and isn’t beginning to think about the negative consequences of his actions.</p>
<p class="txs">On one occasion, when Michael was working on an espionage case at the Agency, the suspect told Michael that he had been labeled by investigators as a “spy.” Michael knew he had to work quickly to reverse the damage created by that harsh language. This simple exchange did the trick:</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> They called you a <span class="epub-i">what</span>?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Suspect:</span> They called me a spy.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> What’s a spy?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Suspect:</span> I don’t know. I guess someone who sells secrets for money.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> You know that’s BS in your case, because we all know you were merely sharing information to help promote the global stability that we’re all working for.</p>
<p class="stx">Yes, it was kind of hokey. But it worked.</p>
<p class="tx">It’s also important to bear in mind that the use of insulting or offensive language can cause a person to clam up altogether. Michael was once hired by a prominent criminal defense lawyer who was representing a client of Chinese descent. The client was a nuclear physicist employed by a major defense contractor, and he had allegedly provided classified information to Chinese intelligence services. He had been under FBI surveillance for some time, and was photographed and recorded meeting with known Chinese intelligence agents on numerous occasions.</p>
<p class="tx">He was brought in for questioning, and for what the FBI fully expected to be a confession, considering the amount of incriminating evidence that had been collected. According to the suspect, when he walked into the interrogation room to be questioned by two FBI agents, one of the agents opened the encounter with the instruction, “Sit over there, Chinaman.”</p>
<p class="tx">That treatment contrasted sharply with the respectful approach taken by Michael, whose understanding and sincerity had led the suspect to open up to him much more extensively than he had to the FBI. In fact, when he heard that racial slur, the suspect said he told himself, “No matter how much evidence they produce, no matter how obvious my guilt becomes, I will never, never, never give these two agents the satisfaction of obtaining my confession.” In the end, the government struck a plea bargain that resulted in no prison time for this nuclear scientist who ultimately confessed to passing secrets to China.</p>

<p class="tnis">Let’s say it’s Friday night, and you’ve gone with your significant other to see a movie. Being the good moviegoing citizen you are, you turned your phone off when you were instructed to do so by the zombie/cowboy/warrior in the clever spot following the previews of coming attractions. After the movie, as you’re walking out of the theater, you turn your phone back on, and you see you have a missed call and a voicemail from a number you don’t recognize. You’re curious, so you decide to listen to the voicemail—chatting with your significant other about the movie will have to wait. You tap the button on the voicemail screen, and this is what you hear:</p>
