<p class="tni">A sixteen-year-old girl we’ll call “Judy” let something slip in a casual conversation with the female dispatcher at a local police department. Judy, who worked at the station as a member of the Police Explorers, an auxiliary police program for young people, mentioned to the dispatcher that she had engaged in a sex act with an officer on the force. What Judy didn’t realize at the time was that the police officer, whom we’ll call “Ralph,” was dating the dispatcher.</p>
<p class="tx">The dispatcher, as you might imagine, was furious, and she reported the incident to the police chief. Ralph, a handsome twenty-four-year-old who was well liked by everyone in the department, vehemently denied the accusation, which had to do with an incident of mutual masturbation in Ralph’s truck. Following an internal investigation, everyone involved—the police chief, lieutenants, sergeants, the investigator from the district attorney’s office—believed that Ralph was telling the truth, and that Judy had fabricated the entire story. Even Judy’s father was overheard screaming at her, “I want you to stop fucking lying to these men, and tell them the truth!”</p>
<p class="tx">Judy’s physical description of Ralph’s genitals was inaccurate (we’ll spare you the details), and there were apparent inconsistencies in her story as to where the act took place. But what really convinced the investigators that she was lying was her “lack of emotion” in recounting the details of the incident. They were certain that a sixteen-year-old girl’s behavior would be akin to that of a traumatized rape victim if she had been telling the truth, so her composure in recounting the incident was seen as a conspicuous red flag. But Judy stuck unwaveringly to her story.</p>
<p class="tx">That’s when Michael entered the scene. He was called in to interview Judy, and to confirm that she was lying.</p>
<p class="tx">It made for a long day. It was a four-hour drive to the town where the police department was located, and Michael was scheduled for an early morning interview with Judy. As the interview got under way, Michael soon recognized that there was a very reasonable explanation for why she had been so composed in recounting the story: She was an enthusiastic participant, and actually had hoped for such an encounter with Ralph. She was anything but traumatized.</p>
<p class="tx">Throughout the interview, Michael closely observed the verbal and nonverbal behaviors Judy exhibited in response to his questions, and he came to his conclusion with a high degree of certainty: Judy was telling the truth. That meant Michael needed to have a chat with Ralph.</p>
<p class="tx">At the conclusion of the interview with Judy, Michael met with the police chief in his office, along with several of the investigating officers. They were stunned when Michael told them that in his professional opinion Judy was telling the truth. But the police chief didn’t hesitate. Ralph was at home, having been placed on administrative leave with pay to wait out the investigation. The police chief called him and ordered him to report immediately to the station for an interview with Michael.</p>
<p class="tx">As we pointed out in Chapter 6, it’s essential for an interviewer to be as informed as possible about the interviewee’s background, so that this information can be incorporated into the monologue, should the interview transition to an interrogation. Michael knew that Ralph had been honorably discharged from the U.S. Marine Corps, and that he was divorced, with a reputation as a ladies’ man in the community.</p>
<p class="tx">We’ve found that the more we know about the person’s less fortunate life circumstances, the better equipped we will be to develop an effective interrogation strategy. These circumstances might include financial difficulties, alcohol or drug dependency, relationship problems, being raised in a one-parent household or on the wrong side of the tracks, physical abuse, racism, sexism, employment issues, or simple bad luck. All of these circumstances are fertile ground for exploitation as we build rationalization into the monologue.</p>
<p class="txs">During the nonaccusatory investigative interview, the interviewer should take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves to begin planting seeds in the event of a subsequent interrogation. In Michael’s interview with Ralph, such an opportunity arose when he learned that Ralph’s alleged misconduct had been characterized by the investigators in extremely harsh language. This is how it played out:</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> How did you learn of the allegations against you?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I was getting ready for work, and they told me to come meet the chief. I was thinking, there are only two reasons for meeting the chief—when you’re doing good, or you’re doing bad. So I just came in, and they sat me down and the chief told me what the allegations are—that I molested Judy. I didn’t know what to think. That’s how I heard of it.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> That’s what he called it—“molesting”? That’s the word he used?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Okay. That’s kind of a strong word.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Yeah.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> How did you feel when he said that?</p>
<p class="dias"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Like my life had stopped. Those are serious allegations. I couldn’t think. I didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p class="dias">[Michael was thinking, <span class="epub-i">Hey, Ralph, how about saying, I DIDN’T DO IT!]</span></p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> What did you say?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I didn’t say anything. They just walked me out and I sat down and spoke with the Department of Justice investigator.</p>
<p class="stx">From that brief exchange, Michael knew that a major psychological hurdle he would need to overcome during the interrogation would require him to reframe the allegation so that it wasn’t presented in terms of Judy having been “molested.” He needed to use a softer, more psychologically acceptable term, like “inappropriate touching.”</p>
<p class="txs">Another means of gaining insight into potential psychological hurdles that will need to be overcome during an interrogation is to simply ask. A hypothetical question can be particularly effective, as Michael demonstrated in this case:</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> If someone did what Judy said happened here, what do you think the person would be afraid of? What would be the person’s biggest reason not to want to tell the truth about that? What would be their greatest fear?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Like if I did it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> You or anybody who had done something like what Judy said happened.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I guess if they’re an adult and she’s a minor, I guess worried about going to jail or something.</p>
<p class="stx">Bingo! That new information would be solid gold in an interrogation. Now Michael knew the biggest psychological hurdle he’d need to overcome in order to turn Ralph’s “no” into “yes” was his fear of going to the Big House should he confess.</p>
<p class="txs">Michael had gotten enough information to be convinced that Ralph was indeed lying, so it was time to switch to interrogation mode. His transition statement took the form of a DOG, and he began by explaining how he knew that Ralph wasn’t being truthful:</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Basically, what we are able to do now is just based upon the way a person looks, acts, and talks, we know whether he is telling the truth or not. Because people do certain things and they say things certain ways when they tell the truth, and they do certain things and say certain things when they don’t tell the truth. And, quite frankly here, Ralph, based on the verbal and nonverbal behaviors you have displayed during our interview, and based upon the investigation itself, there is no question that there was sexual activity between you and Judy.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> [Silence]</p>
<p class="stx">It’s important to note here that throughout the interrogation, you need to remain firmly in what we call “L-squared mode.” That is, you need to simultaneously <span class="epub-i">look</span> and <span class="epub-i">listen</span> to track the subject’s verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Beyond the obvious advantage of determining truth and deception, this assessment model serves as a road map to track progress, or lack thereof, as the interrogation unfolds. In this case, Ralph’s failure to deny reinforced Michael’s initial assessment that Ralph was being deceptive, and that he was on the right course.</p>
<p class="txs">Michael threw Ralph a lifeline of hope, sliding into his monologue since Ralph had yet to offer any resistance.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Now, the good news is the verbal and nonverbal behavior you’ve displayed has shown me that you are not what I would classify as a typical sex offender. You’re not even close to that. So, I’m going to be able to say conclusively that you’re not necessarily a threat to anybody.</p>
<p class="diatx">I think when you get down to the brass tacks of this thing, my gut feeling is they are going to find out that this was probably all Judy’s idea, and that you absolutely didn’t do anything to encourage it, nor did you force anything, and that one thing led to another. We all make mistakes in judgment. But because you are in the law enforcement setting, nobody wants to spoil anything for you. I can tell just from talking to you that you are an outstanding police officer.</p>
<p class="diatx">I don’t want to ruin anything for you. But what’s happened here, what I wanted to say, is they should have known better. Through no fault of yours, they have kind of unconsciously put the fear of God in you, and forced you into a position where it’s been really hard for you to tell the truth. Had they not labeled it “molestation,” I think you would have leveled with them. Had they handled you differently, I think you would have said, “Yeah, it was stupid and I shouldn’t have done it.” But then they started throwing out those buzzwords that would have scared <span class="epub-i">me</span> off. And, because you’re new in the profession and you’re green, you don’t know how these administrative things go. You’re fearful of how you may be looked upon. Everybody that I’ve talked to speaks very highly of you, and that’s not going to change based on a silly little thing like this.</p>
<p class="diatx">Now, if you had forced Judy, if you had got her drunk or gave her drugs or taken advantage of her like that—see, that would have been a whole different thing. But none of that happened. If Judy was eight years old or nine years old, that would be a completely different thing. But she’s almost eighteen. She’s for all practical purposes an adult. And, twenty-four isn’t that old. You’re not that much beyond her age.</p>
<p class="stxs">Ralph was nodding in agreement.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Now, if I was with Judy—I’m fifty-one years old—then people might look at that and say that’s weird, that’s age inappropriate. I’m not real quick with math, but I know fifty-one minus sixteen—that’s a lot of years, and so that would be really embarrassing for me. Or if Chief here ended up with Judy, that would be really embarrassing.</p>
<p class="diatx">I’m married. I don’t know if Chief is married. He probably is, but you’re not even married, see, so, these kinds of things happen in the workplace all the time. There’s always sexual tension in the workplace. And I’m not even implying that you had the hots for Judy, because I know you didn’t. I’m not implying that you singled her out or selected her and then seduced her, went after her. That’s not the case at all.</p>
<p class="diatx">All that’s happened here is, my gut is, she came to you, saw you as someone she was attracted to and said, “Hey, Ralph, can you give me a ride home?” And you thought it was an innocent thing. And, you’re a nice guy, thinking nothing’s behind it. Why not give her a ride home? And then one thing led to another, and then this thing happened and you think it’s no big deal, just a quickie, a one-night-stand kind of thing, and not that much happened anyway. And for all you knew, it was over with, and no big deal. And then months later they come to you. You had probably completely forgotten about it, and then all of a sudden here it is, and it’s taken on a life of its own. And it’s silly. It’s unfortunate.</p>
<p class="diatx">They don’t want to be wasting their time on something goofy like this, because it’s just goofy. They want to resolve it so everyone can move on. And you can move on and do what you’ve got to do because you’ve got big things ahead of you. You’ve got an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps. You’re on track. Everything career-wise is on track, and my guess is you’ll probably get some education along the way somewhere, too. You’ve got big plans, and there’s no reason that can’t continue.</p>
<p class="diatx">But part of being in law enforcement is being honest. And it’s hard to be honest sometimes not knowing for sure what’s going to happen or knowing how people are going to view you. But one thing you should know is we all blow things out of proportion. Anything we do wrong, we magnify it because we’re talking about ourselves. It makes us feel guilty, and we’re ashamed.</p>
<p class="diatx">It’s the good people that magnify things, the good people that are hard on themselves. And you’ve been at this game long enough to know that it’s the bad people that don’t care, it’s the bad people who think what they did isn’t that big of a deal, even robbing and raping and killing. In their world it’s just another day at the beach. It’s just part of their whole lifestyle. In your world and in my world, even speeding makes us feel guilty. This particular thing probably didn’t make you feel guilty when it happened because it was consensual and she agreed to do it, she enjoyed it. You didn’t force her to do anything, and then you took her home. She actually bragged to her friends because she was proud of it, and it was no big deal.</p>
<p class="diatx">It’s when it accidentally leaked out that they felt compelled to follow up on it a little bit so that they could kind of nip this thing in the bud to make sure that, first of all, you’re not the kind of person who would force someone. Second of all, that you’re not the kind of person that would try to do this with someone who was five or six years old. That’s what I call molestation.</p>
<p class="diatx">Getting back to what I said, when you work in law enforcement, gosh darn it, you have to bite the bullet sometimes because we all make mistakes. Everybody who works here or any other police department, they’ve all done some things that they have regretted; done some things they knew they shouldn’t have done. But we’re all human. Don’t let this ruin your career. One little mistake. People make mistakes all the time.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> If I say it happened, my career in law enforcement is over.</p>
<p class="stnis">That was a very informative comment from Ralph. His continued lack of denial was strengthening Michael’s belief that Ralph did, in fact, molest Judy. And he was expressing his reason for resisting the idea of confessing.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Who knows?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I know.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I just know.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> We’ll deal with that, but first of all we need to get something going for you. I mean if I just walk out of here and say, “Hey, Ralph did it and he just doesn’t care. He doesn’t even care enough to tell the truth…”</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I care.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I know you care, and I want you to care. It’s obvious that you care. I want to be able to show that you worked with me. I want to be able to show that you cooperated. I want to be able to show that you are sorry. I want to be able to show that you are never ever going to do anything like this again because I truly, honestly believe that. I need to tell them that you resolved it.</p>
<p class="stnis">At that point, Ralph had his face in his hands, and he was beginning to cry.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> You’re not a molester. For them to say that is not accurate, and I’m going to tell them that because I know you’re not. I know you’re not, Ralph.</p>
<p class="stnis">Michael sensed that Ralph might have been psychologically prepared to tell the truth, so he decided it was time to evaluate his progress by asking a presumptive question.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Was it her idea?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> No, it wasn’t my idea. Nothing was my idea.</p>
<p class="stnis">Ralph apparently misheard the question, perhaps because he was expecting Michael to ask if it was his idea.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Was it her idea?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I was taking her home.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I know that. It’s over, Ralph. You’ve got to tell the truth. This is hard. I know it’s hard. I know you’re strong. I know you’ve got the courage to do it. But the last thing you need is to walk away from it without clearing it up, because then people are going to think the worst about you. There is no reason for anybody to do that. We’re going to handle this discreetly. I’m just going to talk to the investigators about it, but we need to clear it up.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> What’s going to happen?</p>
<p class="stnis">Ralph’s statement was one of resignation. It was a critical turning point in the interrogation. He was no longer resisting, but rather weighing his options to determine whether confessing was or was not his best course of action, depending upon the punishment that would lie ahead. It is at this point that some interrogators succumb to the temptation to make threats, or to make promises they can’t keep. Falling into this trap will invalidate the confession in any court of law. It’s essential that you never make threats or promises in an interrogation scenario. If there’s a Golden Rule in elicitation, it is this: Never do or say anything that could make an innocent person confess.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I’m glad you brought that up. First, I don’t know the answer to that. What I do know is there are a variety of means of resolving these matters, and prosecution is only one of them. This is a very important decision that will affect your future, your career as a law enforcement officer. The people that make the decision are going to have to consider some things, and this is what they’ll have to consider. They’ll have to decide whether you have been completely truthful and cooperative, whether you’re honest. Second, they will want to know if you genuinely understand that you made a mistake, and that you care enough to clear it up. I want to be able to tell them that Ralph cares. They’ll want to know that you had the guts to admit your mistake, and that you will never make this same mistake again. I want to be able to tell them that, and it’s important. Most importantly, they’ll want to know that you are sorry for what you did. And I want to be able to tell them that he’s sorry, he’s really sorry. I want to be able to tell them that there was no force, and that it was consensual. It was a one-time thing, spur-of-the-moment. Something you didn’t plan out. It just happened, and it was absolutely out of character for you. I want to be able to tell them that. So whoever makes the decision about your future, those are the important things they’ll want to have answers to. And, unless you clear it up, you’re going to make their decision easy, very easy. But if you own up to it and you apologize, and you say you’re sorry, and you care and they see that, and they already like you, and they already think the world of you, then these people are going to come to what I would say is a very reasonable decision that you all can live with. But the first step is to break through that denial that you’re in right now. That’s the first step. And that’s the part that would bother them. I know you’re sorry, I know you’re sorry. I know you feel bad.</p>
<p class="stnis">Michael, again sensing that Ralph might be ready to confess, decided to once again evaluate his progress by asking another presumptive question.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Is Judy the only one this ever happened with?</p>
<p class="stni">Ralph was crying. He nodded his head in a “yes” motion. That was the truth that Michael had been working to elicit. And that’s a critical distinction: The goal of any ethical interrogator is never to get a confession, but rather to get the truth.</p>
<p class="txs">In this case, the truth was indeed a confession, and Michael needed to corroborate it. That effort often involves handling a great deal of emotion and further resistance.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> That’s what I thought.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> [Crying]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> It’s all right. It’s all right. I know it’s tough. After it happened, did you feel guilty, or did you just kind of think, well, this will go away?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> [Crying, not responding]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Tell me what led up to it. How it all happened.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I don’t remember.</p>
<p class="stnis">In an interrogation situation, guilty suspects frequently exhibit selective memory. In this case, it took the form of resistance in an attempt to avoid providing incriminating information. It can be frustrating, but it’s essential that you not allow it to make you confrontational. Michael took it in stride.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Well, you remember enough.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> She just said, “Take me home.”</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> All right. And then what happened?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I don’t know. We just drove. I don’t even know where we were at.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> [Continues to cry]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> It’s all right, it’s all right. It’s tough.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I’ve ruined my whole life.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Oh, no, no, no. Not even close. It seems like that now. It really does. It seems like that now, but it doesn’t have to, not at all, not at all. And like I said before, don’t blow this out of proportion. This is not that big of a deal.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Yeah, it is.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Well to you, I know, to you. I know to you at this point in time it is. It’s a big deal to you. But you didn’t kill anybody. You didn’t rape anybody. You didn’t hurt anybody.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Yeah, but I’m going to jail.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Well, what did the DA investigator tell you they were going to do?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I don’t know. He was hitting me hard.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Well, I don’t know. Who am I to know whether you are going to jail or not? Let me ask you this: Did you have sexual intercourse with her?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Oh, God no!</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Why did you guys stop?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I don’t know. I don’t even remember. I don’t even remember. I don’t even remember why we stopped. No clue. I just remember we stopped. I just said, “Let’s go.”</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Were you starting to feel a little weirded out about what was going on? You started to realize what you were doing was wrong and felt kind of bad about it?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> [Crying, nodding his head in a “yes” motion]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> See, that’s good. That’s good. If you were a bad person, you wouldn’t have thought there was anything wrong with it.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I can’t look the people in the face.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> It’s all right, all right. Tell me about what happened that night in the truck.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> [Crying] All I remember is that … oh, man.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Come on, Ralph.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I don’t know. I was just thinking how … oh, God … you know, her touching me and me touching her and then I stopped.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> The only thing that touched your penis was her hand?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Uh-huh.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Okay. About how long did that last while she was masturbating you?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Seconds.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> What would you guess?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Ten seconds maybe, I don’t know. I don’t even like that.</p>
<p class="stnis">People who confess almost always minimize their conduct, so getting the full story can be like squeezing blood from a turnip. Indeed, rarely do we ever get the complete story. The goal is to get as close to the full truth as possible, so the decision makers have as much accurate information as possible upon which to administer justice. Also noteworthy here is Ralph’s classic convincing statement, “I don’t even like that.” Deceptive indicators frequently appear throughout interrogations, and help to serve as a map to where to dig more deeply for additional information.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Tell me about putting your finger into her vagina.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I just like rubbed … fuck.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> At least the tip of your finger went in her vagina a little bit, right?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> [Crying, nodding his head in a “yes” motion]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> How long would you say your finger was in her vagina?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Not even a minute—thirty seconds. This whole thing maybe lasted enough to pull over, five seconds; not five seconds, but a short time. I can’t live with this.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Yes, you can. You will, you will. It’s hard now. It’s hard now, but it will pass, it will pass.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I’m done, I’m done.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> We don’t know that. We don’t know that.</p>
<p class="stnis">Often at this point in an interrogation, guilty suspects who have confessed perceive their whole world to be crashing down upon them. Consequently, they must be handled delicately, and with a great deal of understanding and compassion. They must be restored psychologically, so they can depart with as much respect and dignity as possible. We’ve found it’s very helpful in that situation to remember the adage “There, but for the grace of God, go I.”</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I loved it here, too. Sorry. I just don’t know what to think right now. My girlfriend’s going to leave me.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> We don’t know that. How long have you been with her?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Not long. A few months.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> She cares about you.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Yeah, but …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> She might not even have to find out about this. Let’s wait and see where this thing’s going to go. All right?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> I’ve got to tell all my lieutenants that I lied to them.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> No, no. They’ve all been lied to before. I’m sure they’ve lied to other people themselves. You’re a human being. That’s all you are. That’s all I am.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> They trust me and I betrayed their trust. And this ain’t cheap! [Ralph was referring to the fee for Michael’s professional services.]</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> [Laughs] This is tax dollars, this is tax dollars. This is nothing. Don’t worry about that. This is the least of your worries. People are going to respect you. People are going to respect you—that you had the guts to own up to it.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Yeah, but I should have told them.</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> Look, and I wasn’t kidding before when I told you, if they’d handled you differently, if they hadn’t scared you away in the beginning, I think you would have told the truth. I really do. Don’t you think?</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Ralph:</span> Yeah, when they told me I molested her …</p>
<p class="btni"><span class="epub-b">Michael:</span> I know that. I know that.</p>
<p class="stni">At that point, the lieutenant overseeing the investigation was brought into the interrogation room. Ralph repeated his confession in the lieutenant’s presence. In the end, he didn’t go to jail. He was terminated, but he was later hired by another police department. And Judy was vindicated.</p>
