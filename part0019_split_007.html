<p class="apct"><span class="epub-b">MONOLOGUES AND LEVERAGING THE POWER OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE</span></p>
<p class="tni">In presenting a monologue, the aim is to help make the person feel good about himself, and to feel that he isn’t being judged. That effort is bolstered by gaining an understanding of c<span class="epub-i">ognitive dissonance</span>—the mental discomfort felt by a person who holds two conflicting ideas or beliefs simultaneously.</p>
<p class="tx">George Orwell, in his classic <span class="epub-i">1984</span>, referred to the concept of simultaneously holding two conflicting beliefs as “doublethink.” In Orwell’s dystopia, doublethink created no discomfort, because people were oblivious to the conflict. In the real world, we’re very much aware of it, and we tend to deal with the discomfort it causes by changing our thought processes. In a sense, we alter our perception of reality to explain away the conflict.</p>
<p class="tx">A popular illustration of cognitive dissonance, taught in business negotiation courses the world over, is given to us in Aesop’s fable, “The Fox and the Grapes.” In that story, a fox desperately wanted a deliciously tempting bunch of grapes that were hanging from a vine, just beyond his reach. Try as he might, the fox couldn’t figure out a way to reach them.</p>
<p class="tx">When the fox realized there was no way he would be able to get to the grapes, he had to reconcile the conflict that presented itself: He was a smart fox whose cunning ways had always gotten him what he wanted, yet he was outwitted by the mere location of the delicious grapes. So, rather than conclude that he was not as cunning as he thought he was, he decided that he didn’t really want the grapes after all. He dealt with the dissonance by telling himself that the grapes were likely bitter, or sour—hence the phrase “sour grapes.”</p>
<p class="tx">Anyone who commits a crime, misrepresents the facts, or tells a lie may put himself in a situation that forces him to deal with cognitive dissonance. Generally, the person is well aware that doing those things is wrong, and therefore bad. Yet he likely doesn’t think of himself as a wrongdoer, or a bad person, so he’s forced to reconcile these conflicting beliefs. In an interrogation situation, the monologue serves as a means of aiding that reconciliation in a way that’s conducive to a confession, because it relieves the person of the mental discomfort that’s caused by the dissonance.</p>
<p class="tx">The monologue is meant to prevent the person from focusing on the ramifications of the wrongdoing by keeping him in short-term thinking mode. We help him alleviate the pain he’s feeling by giving him a remedy: a convincing argument, strengthened by rationalization, minimization, and socialization, that resolves the conflict. The resolution allows him to acknowledge the bad act, without having to accept the premise that he’s a bad person.</p>
<p class="tx">Let’s look at how this might work in a negotiation situation.</p>
<p class="tx">I once had a client who hired a contractor to construct a new office building. The project was “cost plus,” meaning my client agreed to pay the cost of the construction plus a fee for the contractor, rather than agreeing on a set amount up front. After the job was completed, the cost that the contractor billed was far higher than what my client had anticipated. As a result, a lawsuit was filed. At a mediation hearing convened to try to settle the suit, this is the way we approached the matter:</p>
<p class="tx">“Look, I know that in every business it’s so easy to get swamped with work, and sometimes things just fall through the cracks or are missed, and sometimes we can miscount or miscalculate, or those who we employ as subcontractors can do the same thing. That’s just the nature of being very good at what you do, because it makes you so busy that things can and do get muddled up. I think that may have happened here, because the figure you gave my client is vastly different from the figure that he had come up with when he priced this out. I wonder if it might be possible for us to take a step back, take a look at all of the bills from suppliers and subcontractors, and then look at the calculations again.”</p>
<p class="tx">That approach led to a settlement that my client was pleased with. Chances are, if we had gone into the mediation and given the contractor the impression that we were calling him a liar or a cheat, we would have gotten nowhere. Rationalizing, minimizing, and identifying potential justifications all help to lower defenses that might otherwise make getting the truth next to impossible.</p>
