<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_0">ACTIVE PRACTICE</h2>

<p class="tni">In preparing for any kind of encounter, it’s essential to recognize that there is no substitute for actual practice. Just as you would never perform surgery after simply reading a textbook on surgical techniques, you can’t assume that reading this book, or any other book, will adequately prepare you for a situation in which your aim is to get the truth. As with any other skill, you need to practice what you have learned on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="tx">I can well remember the very first big criminal case that I was to try as a lawyer. I was fresh out of law school and was appointed to represent a defendant on a very serious felony charge (thankfully the representation-by-rookie scenario is no longer possible in the state where I live). I performed research, interviewed witnesses, studied the case law, learned about the presiding judge, and familiarized myself with my client’s codefendants. The one area where I was lacking was in actually trying cases before juries. I had studied trial advocacy in law school, and tried mock cases before mock juries, but I had yet to do it where it mattered.</p>
<p class="tx">To overcome this problem, I enlisted the assistance of two mentors. The first one, who had been practicing for a couple years and who was, in my eyes, a savvy veteran of the criminal courts, sat with me for jury selection. We got through that process with very little trouble, and with plenty of pointers from my mentor I felt nearly invincible. During a short recess before the opening statements, I turned to my trusted advisor.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is going great!” I said enthusiastically. “Now that you’ve seen the jury, what suggestions do you have for my opening statement?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not sure,” he replied. “I’ve never gotten past this point in a jury trial.” It turned out that my mentor was indeed an experienced criminal defense lawyer, but only in district court, where cases are tried before judges, not juries.</p>
<p class="tx">Fortunately, the second lawyer who was mentoring me, a seasoned pro in jury trials, arrived. He didn’t bother to contain his laughter when he saw the look on my face and I told him about my predicament. In the end, I received a reprieve: The district attorney came over and said that based on evidence gathered from a codefendant, they were dismissing the felony charges against my client. It was way too close for comfort, but it taught me a lesson I’ve never forgotten: Relying on someone else’s skills, rather than concentrating on developing your own, can be disastrous.</p>
<p class="tx">I’m frequently chided by colleagues for the fact that I tell my students to ignore anyone who says to them, “Wait until you get out into the real world.” That’s nonsense. We’re not playing roles in <span class="epub-i">Avatar</span>—we were born into the real world, and we’re in situations where we have to interact, resolve conflicts, assess credibility, and persuade others every day. So it’s best not to rely on “experts,” but rather to practice your skills at every opportunity.</p>
